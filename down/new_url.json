I'm Sophie…</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. So, Sophie I watched Snow White and the Huntsma</span>\n<span>n on TV last night.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Oh, you mean the modern retelling of the story Snow White<em>?</em> Did you enjoy it, Neil?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>It was OK. But the seven dwarves were no fun. I prefer the original Disney cartoon version.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Don't be silly, Neil. Walt Disney didn't invent the story. The movie you watched is a <strong>remake</strong>, a film that has been made again, but the fairy tale is very old.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that may be true, but I still prefer the Disney version with funny dwarves. In the new version, even the names of the dwarves are different and, you know, serious looking.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>But this new version is for young adults – it's a different <strong>genre</strong> – or style – of film. Names like Sneezy, Dopey, Happy and Grumpy are too childish. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Hmm. What's wrong with childish?</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>It's right up your street, isn't it Neil?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Too right. </span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Anyway, fairy tales are the subject of today's show, and I have a question for you: which movie star played the role of the evil fairy in Maleficent, a 2014 film based on the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty? Was it…<br/></span>\n<span>a) Cate Blanchett?<br/></span>\n<span>b) Angelina Jolie?<br/></span>\n<span>Or c) Meryl Streep?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, I'll go for a) Cate Blanchett. She often plays evil characters. I can't forget her in the 2008 movie Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, we'll find out if you chose the right move star later on in the programme. But to return to the idea of childish fairy stories, let's listen to Diane Purkiss, a children's author, talking about how originally fairy tales were intended for an adult audience.</span>\n<strong><span>INSERT<br/>Diane Purkiss, children's author<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Interestingly there has been a bit of a move towards seeing fairy tales as an adult, or at any rate a young adult – a dark sort of genre. And that's natural because actually in the past fairy tales were told by adults to adults in William Shakespeare's time. It's only in the Victorian era that they become moral children's tales and it looks like we're going back to the inception of fairy stories now with a more adult take on them.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Diane Purkiss. So these Hollywood remakes aimed at the teen market are actually returning fairy tales to an adult audience. </span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That's right, Neil. And <strong>dark</strong> here means scary or frightening. The Victorians <strong>toned down</strong> this dark content – or made it less forceful. They also introduced a <strong>moral</strong> – or message about what's right and wrong – to the tales.  </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And <strong>inception</strong> means the beginning. So fairy tales began as a dark genre.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Can you give us some examples of dark stories written by the brothers Grimm, Neil?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well… I have a list here. Let's see. In The Frog Prince the princess doesn't kiss the frog, she throws it… she throws it against the wall! Hmm, yes.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Hmm. I prefer the kiss version.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And in Little Red Riding Hood don't believe that version where the wolf shuts granny in a cupboard. In the real version he gobbles her up and then eats Red Riding Hood for dessert.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Charming. And to <strong>gobble something up</strong> means to eat it very fast. OK, that's enough. Let's move on. Did you know that some of the stories – like Beauty and the Beast, Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, and Snow White go back much further than the earliest written stories – even the ones in Latin and Greek?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>No, I didn't. To be honest, Sophie, I thought Walt Disney had written them.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Oh Neil… well research suggests that some fairy tales date back to well before the brothers Grimm and even Shakespeare. Let's hear more from Dr Jamie Tehrani, anthropologist at Durham University in the UK.</span>\n<strong><span>INSERT<br/>Dr Jamie Tehrani, anthropologist at Durham University<br/></span></strong>\n<span><strong>Dr JTehrani:</strong> So these fairy tales that we've looked at – we've been able to trace back, really, thousands of years – probably sort of 4-6,000 years is the origin of many famous European folk tales, stories such as Beauty and the Beast.<br/></span>\n<span><strong>BBC Reporter:</strong> What, 6,000 years?!<br/></span>\n<span><strong>Dr J Tehrani:</strong> Yep, going right back to the Bronze Age. <br/></span>\n<span><strong>BBC Reporter:</strong> Good heavens!<br/><strong>Dr J Tehrani:</strong> We've been able to trace the transmission across generations of these stories much further back than is generally recognized.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>But Sophie – if there's no written evidence of the stories from 6,000 years ago how does Dr Tehrani, who we've just heard from, know people were telling them?</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, dating languages isn't something I'm familiar with – I think it's a bit like looking at a few dinosaur bones and trying to reconstruct what dinosaurs looked like. But here you're trying to reconstruct stories without any actual bits. It must have been hard work for the researchers. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Indeed. Well, I think it's time to hear the quiz question again, Sophie.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK, I asked: Which movie star played the role of the evil fairy in Maleficent, a film based on the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty? Was it… a) Cate Blanchett? b) Angelina Jolie? Or c) Meryl Streep?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I said Cate Blanchett.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And you were wrong. Angelina Jolie played the main character in the film Maleficent. Cate Blanchett played the elf queen Galadriel in Lord of the Rings. And Meryl Streep played a blue-haired witch in the 2014 film Into the Woods.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Now, can we hear those words again?</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK!<br/></span>\n<span>remake<br/></span>\n<span>genre <br/></span>\n<span>dark<br/></span>\n<span>toned down<br/></span>\n<span>moral<br/></span>\n<span>inception<br/></span>\n<span>gobble up</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that's the end of today's spellbinding 6 Minute English.

I'm Sophie…</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil… Sophie – did you go on the corporate awayday last week?</span>\n<span><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Yes… you didn't miss anything. A team building guru lectured us on how to work more effectively with each other. We gave some presentations, had a few drinks after…  </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Right. OK. An <strong>awayday</strong> is a day that employees spend together away from their usual workplace. And a <strong>guru</strong> is an expert in something. So did this guru teach you anything new, Sophie?</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>No… not really. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Shame. I was hoping for some tips on how to work more effectively with my co-presenter.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I think we work very effectively already, Neil. Now, today's show is about <strong>team building</strong> – or encouraging employees to work well together as a team by getting them to engage in different types of activities.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And apparently, some companies in the UK are offering their employees activities such as…  Hunger Games-style combat days where teams must work together to 'kill' as many of the opposing team as possible. Have you seen the Hunger Games movies, Sophie? </span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>There're also Zombie boot camps where military instructors train you on how to fight zombies – that's dead people who have come back to life. For the more <strong>cerebral</strong> – or brainy – amongst us – there are crime investigations modelled on popular TV dramas like Sherlock Holmes.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, I'm not sure about the Zombie boot camp – a <strong>boot camp</strong> is a short course of hard physical training – but the Sherlock Holmes awayday sounds like fun.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I'd definitely go for the Zombie experience. Though I'm not sure how it connects with most people's working lives. Violence, death, the living dead…</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Good point.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So let's move on and have today's quiz question. What did Chairman Mao introduce in China in1951 as a compulsory activity for workers and was reintroduced by the government a few years ago? Was it…<br/></span>\n<span>a) calisthenics?<br/></span>\n<span>b) calligraphy?<br/></span>\n<span>Or c) English language lessons? </span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span><strong>Calisthenics</strong>, by the way, is a type of gentle physical exercise…</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>… and <strong>calligraphy</strong>, by the way, is the art of writing by hand with a special brush.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, I'm going for a) calisthenics. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Not English language lessons, Sophie?</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>No. I'll stick with callisthenics, thanks. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK. Well, we'll find out later if you're right or not. Now, whilst English lessons might sound like hard work, <em>ukulele</em> lessons are apparently catching on. A ukulele is a musical instrument. Top businessmen Bill Gates and Warren Buffett both do it, and stressed-out city workers are following their lead. Here in the UK, a number of companies have been holding ukulele team building sessions. </span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That sounds amazing. And is there anything about the ukulele in particular that leaves people feeling better after they've played it?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Let's hear more about this from Lorraine Bow, who teaches people to play the instrument. But listen with attention because she spoke on the phone and the line wasn't great.</span>\n<span><strong>INSERT<br/>Lorraine Bow, ukulele teacher <br/></strong></span>\n<span>Well, I guess it's just the fact that you know people don't often sing in their everyday lives and it's the fact that you can play and sing – play a musical instrument – within an hour – it's quite a… you know… it's quite a fulfilling thing really. It's not competitive – it's quite easy to do and a bit less intimidating than a guitar…</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Lorraine, the ukulele teacher, also says her classes aren't competitive or <strong>intimidating</strong>… </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>… which means something that makes you feel nervous. </span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Now, before we hear the answer to today's quiz question, let's hear about a company in Abu Dhabi where leadership is taught through horse training. Basically, you have to go in the yard with a horse and persuade it that you're the boss by using body language. Here's Kelly Eide, co-founder of the company, explaining why she thinks this approach works.</span>\n<strong><span>INSERT<br/>Kelly Eide, Co-founder of True Leadership, Abu Dhabi<br/></span></strong>\n<span>The horses don't care if your hair is purple, if you're a man or a woman, if you're old or young, if you are… what religion. So it transcends all of those cultural boundaries – it transcends age, gender, religion, tradition etc. – so that's a perfect fit. And in an organization where you really need groups of people to gel, who come from backgrounds which have no common norms, you can teach that most efficiently with a horse.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil <br/></span></strong>\n<span>To <strong>gel</strong> with someone means to connect or get on well with someone. So you try and get the horse to do what you want using body language. And the horse feels instinctively whether or not you are a natural leader because it doesn't recognize cultural differences, hair colour and age. </span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Probably easier said than done.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Indeed. Now remember I asked: What did Chairman Mao introduce in China in1951 as a compulsory activity for workers and was reintroduced by the government a few years ago?  Was it… a) calisthenics? b) calligraphy? Or c) English language lessons? </span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I said a) calisthenics.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, you're right on the button! Well done there, Sophie! Calisthenics are used at schools as a warm up for physical education classes, during sports day activities, and by some companies as a way of building morale and a sense of group unity, as well as to raise energy levels and encourage good health. Now <strong>shake a leg</strong> – or in other words – get moving – and tell us the words we learned today, Sophie.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>They are:<br/></span>\n<span>awayday<br/></span>\n<span>guru<br/></span>\n<span>team building<br/></span>\n<span>cerebral<br/></span>\n<span>bootcamp<br/></span>\n<span>callisthenics<br/></span>\n<span>calligraphy<br/></span>\n<span>synchronise<br/></span>\n<span>intimidating<br/></span>\n<span>gel<br/></span>\n<span>shake a leg</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that's the end of this 6 Minute English. We hope you enjoyed it. And don't forget to join us again soon!</span>\n<span><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye.</span>"

I'm Sophie…</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. Sophie – did you see the beautiful sky last night?</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>No, I went to bed early. Why?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I was wondering if there was life out there.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>You mean life on other planets? That's just science fiction, Neil. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>It isn't! People are fascinated by life on other planets for a good reason.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>You believe in little green men?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Not necessarily… but possibly.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, Mars is our closest neighbour in the solar system and the subject of today's show. And that brings me on to our usual quiz question. How long is a day on Mars? Is it about…<br/></span>\n<span>a) 5 hours?<br/></span>\n<span>b) 25 hours?<br/></span>\n<span>Or c) 45 hours?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And I think it must be c) 45 hours. Things are weird on other planets. And Mars is further from the sun than us… Mars may be our closest neighbour, but it's hardly in our backyard, is it?</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>It is in astronomical terms, Neil – it's visible to <strong>the naked eye</strong> – meaning without using instruments – and it's reachable by spacecraft. Well, we’ll find out later on in the show whether you got the answer right or not. Now can you tell me Neil why people like you get excited about the possibility of life on Mars? </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, Mars is similar to the Earth in some important ways which means if life developed on our planet, why not Mars?</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That's true. Its temperature is in the right zone – not too hot and not too cold. But actually we could find Mars pretty cold – an average temperature would be around minus 63 degrees Celsius compared to Earth's 14 degrees Celsius. It's also very <strong>arid</strong> – or dry. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And it needs to be wet for life to develop, doesn't it?</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That's right. Many scientists think that liquid water is essential for life! But there may have been water on the surface of Mars in the past. And recent research suggests that there may be water underground. Let's hear some more about this from Professor John Zarnecki, who teaches Space Science at The Open University. </span>\n<strong><span>INSERT<br/>John Zarnecki, Professor of Space Science, The Open University<br/></span></strong>\n<span>We are now seeing that in fact Mars probably does have water – not liquid water – that there is ice just below the surface and there's even just recently tantalizing evidence that perhaps water does flow periodically... Now, and also coupled with the fact that here on Earth we're finding that life in very primitive form exists in the most extreme environments, these are the so called 'extremophiles' that exist at the bottom of the oceans… So life is much, much tougher.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>What does <strong>tantalizing</strong> mean, Sophie?</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>It means something you want that's almost, but not quite, within reach. So, scientists would love to think water flows on Mars but the evidence isn't strong enough for this to be certain. The other interesting point the professor makes is that life may exist in the very harsh Martian environment – because primitive life exists in extreme places on Earth.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/>E</span></strong>\n<span><strong>xtremophiles</strong> are <strong>organisms</strong> – or small creatures – that live in very extreme environments and can survive conditions that would kill most other organisms. But on Mars they would be living underground because the <strong>radiation</strong> – or light and heat – from the Sun would kill any organisms living on the surface of the planet. So why doesn’t the Sun's radiation kill us then, Sophie?</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>The Earth has a strong magnetic field created by its hot molten <strong>core</strong> – or centre – and this protects us from the Sun's harmful solar winds. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And what about Mars - why doesn't it have a magnetic field?</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>It used to – 4 billion years ago. It’s possible that a massive <strong>collision</strong> with an asteroid might have heated up Mars's core, disrupting the magnetic fields.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And if you <strong>disrupt</strong> a process you stop it from continuing normally. Now, to return to the subject of collisions, Sophie, I have something very interesting to tell you.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>A <strong>meteorite</strong> – or a piece of rock from outer space – might've crashed into the Earth millions of years ago. That meteorite might have contained Martian life forms. So we might be descended from Martians! </span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That's actually an interesting idea, Neil. But let's listen to Professor John Zarnecki talking about interplanetary life.</span>\n<strong><span>INSERT<br/>John Zarnecki, Professor of Space Science at the Open University<br/></span></strong>\n<span>If we do find traces of life on Mars we don't know, do we - whether it evolved independently or was it perhaps seeded from Earth. It is possible that life forms from Earth travelled to Mars and perhaps existed there – or the other way round. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So life on Mars may have <strong>evolved</strong> – or developed – on its own. Or it might have arrived from Earth in a lump of rock… Or the other way round! So Martians might be humans or we might be Martians! One big interplanetary happy family, Sophie!</span>\n<span><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well Neil, let's hope you stay happy after you hear the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: How long is a day on Mars? Is it … a) 5 hours? b) 25 hours? Or c) 45 hours?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And I said c) 45 hours – they must have a long day over there.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And you were … wrong! The correct answer is b) because a day on Mars is slightly longer than here on Earth – it's 25 hours. </span>\n<span>Anyway, can we at least hear the words we learned today?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>They are:<br/></span>\n<span>the naked eye<br/></span>\n<span>arid<br/></span>\n<span>tantalizing<br/></span>\n<span>extremophiles<br/></span>\n<span>organisms<br/></span>\n<span>radiation<br/></span>\n<span>core<br/></span>\n<span>disrupt<br/></span>\n<span>meteorite<br/></span>\n<span>evolved</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Sophie…</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. I was watching the news the other day, Sophie.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Learn anything interesting?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, actually. UK scientists have been authorised by the government to genetically modify human embryos for research. What they can't do though is implant modified embryos into women. They talked a lot about gene editing... </span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Can you explain to us what gene editing is?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Mmm… I think this means there are these letters in a code – A-B-C something… I can't remember exactly…  </span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span><strong>Gene</strong> <strong>editing</strong> is the ability to <strong>manipulate</strong> – or control – DNA. And in case you didn't know, <strong>DNA</strong> is short for deoxyribonucleic acid – this is a substance in the cells of animals and plants that contains genetic information. And a <strong>gene</strong> is part of the DNA in the cell that controls the physical development and behaviour of a plant or animal and is passed on from its parents.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Phew! Thanks for the science lesson, Sophie. </span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>You're welcome. Now here's a question for you, Neil: Which science fiction film anticipates gene editing in a dystopian society where humans are genetically engineered? Is it…<br/></span>\n<span>a) Robocop<br/></span>\n<span>b) Gattaca<br/></span>\n<span>or c) Blade Runner</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Mmm… I don't really understand the question but I'm going to say c) Blade Runner. What's dystopian?</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span><strong>Dystopian</strong> means an imaginary society where people are unhappy and afraid. Well, moving on, let's listen to BBC journalist Fergus Walsh talking about how gene editing works.</span>\n<span><strong>INSERT<br/>Fergus Walsh, BBC journalist<br/></strong></span>\n<span>Think of gene editing as a molecular sat nav. It scans the DNA searching for the error. Then it uses molecular scissors to snip through both strands, which switches off the faulty gene. Or it can repair the code by inserting a healthy copy of the gene. These techniques raise the prospect of treating – even curing – some genetic diseases – and it's not science fiction.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So DNA is a set of instructions for how our bodies work written using a chemical code of four letters – A, T, C, G. But sometimes the code contains mistakes. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. You find spelling mistakes by <strong>scanning</strong> – or searching – through the DNA. Then you <strong>snip</strong> – or cut out – the mistake or faulty gene from the code using molecular scissors. <strong>Faulty</strong> by the way, means something that isn't working properly – like the faulty brakes on my bike.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That sounds really dangerous, Neil!</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yeah, but I'm more worried about my faulty genes. I might have all sorts of genetic mistakes inside me.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That wouldn't surprise me. But you've actually touched on a serious point. Latest research suggests all our bodies do contain genetic mistakes, some of which could cause disease. And as reporter Fergus Walsh said at the end of the clip, gene editing could be important for treating or even curing inherited genetic diseases. For patients with blood, immune, muscle or skin disorders it offers the possibility that their faulty cells could be removed, or changed in the lab, and then put back. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That sounds amazing. But is there a <strong>catch</strong>?</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And that means a problem or drawback. Yes. Some people think that if editing the genes of a human embryo is allowed for curing disease, this will lead to editing the genes of embryos for reasons other than health. Let's listen to Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the Centre for Genetics and Society in California talking about her concerns.</span>\n<strong><span>INSERT<br/>Marcy Darnovsky, Centre for Genetics and Society<br/></span></strong>\n<span>It's too risky, we don't need it, there are other ways to have healthy children, and it would open the door – possibly – to a world of genetic haves and have nots. We don't need more inequality, we don't need more discrimination in the world. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>An <strong>embryo</strong> by the way is an animal or human starting to develop inside its mother. Marcy Darnovsky is against gene editing because it may be used to create <strong>designer babies</strong> – or babies whose genes have been selected to have certain desirable characteristics.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>She says it may <strong>open the door </strong>– or make it possible – a situation where embryos are genetically <strong>enhanced</strong> – or improved – to be more intelligent or physically stronger, for example.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And this will lead to more <strong>discrimination</strong> in the world – which means treating some people less fairly than others… </span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>…which is something that science fiction has been predicting for many years. It's that dystopian society we were discussing earlier, Neil! Which science fiction film anticipates gene editing in a dystopian society where humans are genetically engineered? Is it… a) Robocop b) Gattaca or c) Blade Runner?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And I said c) Blade Runner.</span>\n<strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Sorry, Neil! It was b) Gattaca. This 1997 sci-fi film centres on the character Vincent Freeman, who wasn't genetically engineered, but is able to buy the genetic identity of another man in order to pursue his dream of travelling into space. The film's title uses the letters G, A, T and C, which are the four chemical codes making up DNA.<br/></span>\n<span>Now here are today's words: <br/></span>\n<span>gene editing<br/></span>\n<span>manipulate<br/></span>\n<span>DNA<br/></span>\n<span>gene<br/></span>\n<span>dystopian<br/></span>\n<span>scanning<br/></span>\n<span>snip<br/></span>\n<span>faulty<br/></span>\n<span>catch<br/></span>\n<span>embryo<br/></span>\n<span>designer babies<br/></span>\n<span>open the door<br/></span>\n<span>enhanced<br/></span>\n<span>discrimination</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Neil…\n<strong>Sophie<br/></strong>\nAnd I'm Sophie…\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nSophie, I can't get out of my head what Mark Zuckerberg, you know, the guy who created Facebook, said recently.\n<strong>Sophie<br/></strong>\nOh, I know, he\n<strong>pledged</strong>\n– or made a serious promise – to give away 99% of his shares in Facebook over the course of his lifetime. The shares are currently worth around $45bn.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWhy, oh why did he decide to give his fortune away? It's puzzling to me.\n<strong>Sophie<br/></strong>\nIt's an act of\n<strong>philanthropy</strong>\n– which means helping others, especially by giving large amounts of money to good causes.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd philanthropy is the subject of this show.\n<strong>Sophie<br/></strong>\nBut don't worry about Zuckerberg, it's probably fair to say that he will remain extremely\n<strong>well off</strong>\n– or wealthy – even after giving away his fortune.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, that's true. Let me ask you then today's quiz question: Who was the most generous philanthropist in the US last year? Was it…\n<br/>\na) Bill Gates\n<br/>\nb) Mark Zuckerberg\n<br/>\nOr c) Warren Buffett\n<strong>Sophie<br/></strong>\nI'm going to say… c) Warren Buffett.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, we'll find out if you were right or not later on in the show. Now, Zuckerberg was inspired to give away his fortune by the birth of his daughter Max. In a letter to Max – posted on Facebook. In his post, he talks about using the money to advance\n<strong>human potential </strong>\nand promote\n<strong>equality</strong>\nfor all children in the next generation. Equality – in other words, with the same rights and opportunities.\n<strong>Sophie<br/></strong>\nZuckerberg is the latest in a long line of billionaire entrepreneurs to turn philanthropist and use his money for good causes. Did you know that some of the earliest American philanthropists were robber barons?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nRobber barons? What's … ? Hang on, what're robber barons?\n<strong>Sophie<br/></strong>\nThey're business people who use\n<strong>unethical -</strong>\nor morally wrong - business tactics to gain large personal fortunes. Nineteenth-century entrepreneurs like Rockefeller, Carnegie and Ford were robber barons. They built up huge empires in industry – oil, steel, railways, and cars – and were largely responsible for transforming the United States from an agricultural nation into an industrial one.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nHenry Ford – he's the one who said you can have any colour you want as long as it's black. I like that kind of thing.\n<strong>Sophie<br/></strong>\nFocus, Neil!\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nOK. OK.\n<strong>Sophie<br/></strong>\nBut as the barons got older, they decided they wanted to give back to society, and turned to philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie believed that wealth should be spent to make the world a better place.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nThat sounds too warm and fuzzy for a\n<strong>ruthless</strong>\n– or cruel - robber baron.\n<strong>Sophie<br/></strong>\nPeople change, Neil! When he died, Carnegie had given away a total of $350m to the state to spend on public works. That's around $8bn in today's money.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, let's listen to Hugh Cunningham, a Professor of History at the University of Kent here, in the UK. He talks about what the\n<strong>average Joe</strong>\n– that's you and me, folks – thinks about big business and philanthropy today.\n<strong>INSERT<br/></strong>\n<strong>Hugh Cunningham, Emeritus Professor of History at the University of Kent<br/></strong>\nThe very word philanthropy does not necessarily have 100% positive connotations for the public at large given where we are in terms of the public's attitude towards business or the banks and that kind of stuff. So I think it's in everyone's interests to try and broaden out the concept of philanthropy into a wider notion of giving, making a contribution, making a difference.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nYes, banks and big businesses can easily afford to give away millions of dollars for the public good if they choose to. It is not so easy when you're an individual struggling to pay the rent.\n<strong>Sophie<br/></strong>\nThat's right, Neil. But a lot of people in the UK are super-rich compared to those in the developing world. And we can make a big difference by\n<strong>donating</strong>\n– or giving – smaller amounts of money to help improve their lives.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd that's what Professor Cunningham means when he says we should broaden out the\n<strong>notion</strong>\n– or idea – of philanthropy. It's not only robber barons who can afford to be philanthropic. Let's listen to Toby Ord, a graduate student from Oxford University talking about how he makes a difference.\n<strong>INSERT<br/></strong>\n<strong>Toby Ord, moral philosopher, Oxford University<br/></strong>\nI worked out that over my life I'd be able to earn about £1.5m and that I could maintain my current standard of living as a graduate student and still donate about £1m of that.\n<strong>Sophie<br/></strong>\nSo Toby actually gives away any money that he earns above £18,000 a year. He feels that he doesn't need more than this amount to maintain his standard of living.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nI'm impressed by Toby's pledge but I don't think I could live like a student my whole life!\n<strong>Sophie<br/></strong>\nI thought that would suit you extremely well, Neil! Now why don't you give us the answer to today's quiz question?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nI asked: Who was the most generous philanthropist in the US last year? Was it… a) Bill Gates? b) Mark Zuckerberg? Or c) Warren Buffett?\n<strong>Sophie<br/></strong>\nI said Warren Buffett.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nGood guess, Sophie! Well done! Buffett, who made his $73bn fortune from investments, donated $2.8bn to charity in 2014 bringing his lifetime total to almost $23bn, according to Forbes. That's\n<strong>a tidy sum</strong>\n– and that means a large number! OK let's hear those words again, Sophie.\n<strong>Sophie<br/></strong>\nHere they are:\n<br/>\npledged\n<br/>\nphilanthropy\n<br/>\nwell off\n<br/>\nhuman potential\n<br/>\nequality\n<br/>\nunethical\n<br/>\nruthless\n<br/>\naverage Joe\n<br/>\ndonating\n<br/>\na tidy sum\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!\n<strong>Both<br/></strong>\nBye."

I'm Alice…</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>… and I'm Neil. Alice, have you got two pounds? I forgot my wallet and I need a coffee. I've only got these pennies.</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Sorry – I always use my bankcard in the cafeteria. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You use a card to buy coffee?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. It's a tap-and-go card so it's quick – you don't enter a PIN number – and everyone in the coffee queue uses them… except you. And today's show is about how we pay for things.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I pay for things with money! </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>There are different kinds of money. You're behind the curve, digging around in your pockets for change, Neil. Do you still use cheques too?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, I do. Cheques are very useful. Now, being <strong>behind the curve</strong> means not keeping up with current trends. So help me keep up, Alice. What's a tap-and-go card? I thought you were talking about your regular bankcard.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well,<strong> tap-and-go </strong>cards are regular bankcards but with a built-in chip and antenna. The card reader sends out a radio frequency and when you bring the card close to the reader, the antenna picks up the signal to make the payment.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Hmm. This antenna business doesn't sound secure – an <strong>antenna</strong> is used for sending or receiving radio signals. Doesn't it mean your personal data is flying around in the ether for anyone to steal?</span>\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Alice</span></strong>\n<span>In this context, <strong>ether</strong> means the air where electronic communication happens. And nothing's flying around, Peter Pan! At less than half a second per transaction, there's no time for anyone to steal your cash! Now, why don't you answer today's quiz question? Which man's face appears on a UK ten pound note? Is it…<br/></span>\n<span>a)   Charles Darwin<br/></span>\n<span>b)   Isaac Newton<br/></span>\n<span>or c)   Albert Einstein<br/><br/></span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>None of them – it's the Queen.<br/><br/></span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>No, Neil. The Queen is on one side, but on the other side of each note is an important historical figure.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Oh really? I've never noticed… OK, I'll go for b) Isaac Newton. He's a historical figure.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So are Darwin and Einstein. And coins and banknotes will be historical soon. But we'll find out if you're right later on. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I'm still concerned about tap-and-go. What if someone steals my card?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Each contactless payment is limited to a certain amount – the UK's limit is £30. After you've used your card a few times in a row, you have to enter your PIN. And if a thief does go on a spending spree with your card, your bank covers you against fraud. Whereas, if someone steals your banknotes, that's your bad luck!</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK, good points. <strong>Fraud</strong> means getting money by cheating people. And a <strong>spending spree</strong> is a short period of time where you do a lot of shopping. Are you a big spender, Alice?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Not with my tap-and-go, Neil. How about you and your chequebook?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>No comment. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Moving on. If getting your bankcard out seems like too much trouble there's now a solution with <strong>wearable tech</strong> – that's clothing and accessories that include computer and electronic technologies. Let's hear what Kenneth Cukier, a technology expert, has to say.</span>\n<span><strong>INSERT<br/>Kenneth Cukier, economist and technology expert<br/></strong></span>\n<span>You can simply take any wireless card and the chip from it that your bank might issue you with, and you can put it into the coat and then when you want to make a payment you just simply wave your arm in front of the terminal and leave with your latte. This is intended for people who are incredibly lazy who don't want to take their card out of their wallet, or use their phone, or use their watch. People are going to be making more purchases more of the time – particularly for small-valued goods.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>What Kenneth Cukier said is very interesting. That sounds tempting but I'm still concerned about how safe this all is. What if I wave my arm around and make a payment by mistake?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>The chip has to get very close to the card reader to make a payment so that's not likely to happen. Now companies are creating new biometric technology – which you might like Neil – because it combines payment and security technology. Let's hear more from the BBC reporter Kate Russell.</span>\n<strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong>\n<strong><span>Kate Russell, BBC reporter</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>For those times when not even carrying a phone is convenient – at the beach or a festival for example – the fingo-pay system reads the unique maps of veins under the surface of your finger. The trick is remembering which finger you registered with.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>This high-tech stuff reporter Kate Russell is talking about is amazing! Some day soon we won't have to carry a wallet or a purse or anything. The veins in our finger will <strong>authenticate</strong> payments – and prove the payments are ours. I can't wait!</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Hmm. Sounds a bit too sci-fi for my liking. How about giving us the answer to today's quiz question?</span>\n<strong>Alice<br/></strong>\nAlright then. I asked: Which man's face appears on a UK ten pound note? Is it… a) Charles Darwin b)  Isaac Newton or c)  Albert Einstein\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">And I said b) Isaac Newton.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. And you were wrong, Neil! It was that other famous person, a) Charles Darwin. Isaac Newton was on the old one pound note which is no longer used. And Einstein was German, not British, so he wouldn't appear on a UK banknote anyway.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well they look similar, I think. Can you tell us today's words once again, Alice?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, of course I can. They are:<br/></span>\n<span>behind the curve<br/></span>\n<span>tap-and-go<br/></span>\n<span>antenna<br/></span>\n<span>ether<br/></span>\n<span>fraud<br/></span>\n<span>spending spree<br/></span>\n<span>wearable tech<br/></span>\n<span>authenticate<br/><br/></span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that's the end of this edition of 6 Minute English.

This is very interesting… I'm proud of our habit of having tea all the time and teabags are great! A marvellous little invention!</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, I agree. Well, that's my question for you today. Where was the teabag invented? Was it in …<br/></span>\n<span>a) China<br/></span>\n<span>b) the US<br/></span>\n<span>Or c) Britain</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Hmm. I buy a lot of teabags but I don't know their history. So I'm going to guess c) Britain. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, we'll find out if you chose the right answer later on. Let's listen now to Professor Markman Ellis talking about the Chinese tea plant. He's a historian at Queen Mary, University of London.</span>\n<span><strong>INSERT<br/>Professor Markman Ellis, historian, Queen Mary, University of London<br/></strong></span>\n<span>Tea is a shrub that grows naturally in the mountainous areas of China and several thousand years ago, no one knows how exactly, there… I mean… there are stories… it became clear that if you consumed the leaves of this plant especially the younger leaves, then it had an interesting effect on you. And that effect could be thought of as medicinal or it could be thought of as just kind of sanative – making you feel a bit better than you used to feel. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Professor Markman Ellis tells us that people in Ancient China <strong>consumed</strong> – or ate – leaves from the tea plant and it had an interesting effect on them. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Professor Ellis says tea has a <strong>sanative</strong> effect – making you feel better – so I might try munching a few leaves later on.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Alright then. Apparently the Chinese started drinking tea because of its <strong>medicinal</strong> – or healing – qualities. And they've been drinking tea for thousands of years! Well we British may love a good cup of tea – but we haven’t been brewing it for nearly so long as the Chinese.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>But remember that tea actually grows in China, Alice. We don't grow it in Britain.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Good point, Neil. Which brings me back to what we were talking about earlier. In the 19th c</span>\n<span>entury the British started to grow tea in India in order to compete with Chinese tea production. When tea first arrived in Britain in the 17th c</span>\n<span>entury it was incredibly expensive and only the elite could afford to drink it.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span><strong>Elite</strong> means a small group of people in society who have money and power. Well, the opposite is true today – everyone drinks tea! And cheap teabags make really strong tea – just the way I like it!</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>[noise of disgust] Oh, it's not for me! I like tea with a delicate flavour – Lapsang Suchong is my favourite with its evocative fragrance.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Not teabags, then? </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>No, Neil. Lapsang is different from other types of tea because the leaves are smoke-dried over pinewood fires giving the tea its distinctive smoky flavour.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>You sound like a TV advert – I can just see the misty mountains and fields of tea… Can you tell us what <strong>evocative</strong> means?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>It means making you imagine something pleasant. And for some people tea drinking is a spiritual experience. Let’s listen to BBC reporter Mike Williams learning about the Asian custom of the tea ceremony.</span>\n<strong><span>INSERT<br/>Mike Williams and his Chinese host<br/></span></strong>\n<span><strong>CH:</strong> Please enjoy a mouthful of green tea.<br/></span>\n<span><strong>MW:</strong> Thank you... That was a bit less than a mouthful. It's a very very small amount, isn't it?<br/></span>\n<span><strong>CH:</strong> It's about 20ml. It's the way to appreciate tea in very small quantities so you can concentrate and cultivate your mindfulness in drinking the tea.<br/></span>\n<span><strong>MW:</strong> Mindfulness? What do you mean by mindfulness?<br/></span>\n<span><strong>CH:</strong> Tea ceremony has some of its origin in Buddhism. The Japanese tea ceremony for example has a lot of Zen Buddhism influence. Mindfulness is the concentration and focus on the now – forget about the past, forget about the future, and enjoy this specific moment. And that's what I call mindfulness. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So they don't use mugs in the tea ceremony. It's 20 millilitres or a mouthful of green tea. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That's right. Drinking just a <strong>mouthful</strong> – or a small amount – helps you concentrate and cultivate mindfulness. As the speaker explains, <strong>mindfulness</strong> means living in the moment and forgetting about the past and future. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, forgive me for thinking about the past – but how about the answer to today’s quiz question?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK then. I asked: Where was the teabag invented? Was it in… </span>\n<span>a) China?, </span>\n<span>b) the US? of </span>\n<span>c) Britain?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And I said c) Britain. And I must be right.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, I'm afraid you're wrong, Neil! It was b) the US. Teabags first appeared commercially in the first decade of the 20th c</span>\n<span>entury and were successfully marketed by Thomas Sullivan, a tea merchant from New York, who shipped his teabags around the world.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Really? Teabags are older than I thought! Now, can you tell us the words we heard today?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>They are:<br/></span>\n<span>brew<br/></span>\n<span>consumed<br/></span>\n<span>sanative<br/></span>\n<span>medicinal<br/></span>\n<span>elite<br/></span>\n<span>evocative<br/></span>\n<span>mouthful<br/></span>\n<span>mindfulness</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. You can go and put the kettle on now for a nice brew. Please join us again soon!</span>\n<span><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye.</span>"

I'm Neil…</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>… and I'm Alice. Now Neil, how do you get to work?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span>\n<span>I cycle.</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong></span>\n<span>I didn't know that! Somehow I hadn't imagined you as a cyclist. And where's all your bike gear?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, I sneak in the mornings, have a shower, and get changed. That's my bike in the corner over there.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Oh, you've got a <strong>foldaway</strong> bike – which means it folds up so it's easy to carry or put away. </span>\n<span>Do you wear lycra, Neil?  </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, I do… it's very comfortable. I wear lycra as often as I can. <strong>Lycra</strong> by the way is a stretchy fabric used in tight-fitting sports clothes. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, I'll have to see if I can catch you on your way into the building – I'm <strong>intrigued</strong> about this sporty Neil I didn't know about!</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>'Intrigued' means to be very interested in something. Well, Alice, I'm flattered. And today's show is about <strong>commuting</strong> – or travelling between your home and your work. So how did you commute this morning, Alice?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I got the <strong>Tube</strong> – that's the subway system here in London, also known as the underground – and it was a nightmare. We stopped in a tunnel for so long that people started talking to each other.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And for those of you who aren't Londoners, that's unusual! Do you ever talk to people on the train?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>No. People think you're crazy if you talk to strangers.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, maybe now's a good time to talk about today's quiz question, Alice. What question do you have for me?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Alright then. I know you like my questions, Neil. So here we go: What did the word 'commuter' originally describe? Was it someone who… <br/></span>\n<span>a) travelled with other people?<br/></span>\n<span>b) paid a reduced fare to travel?<br/></span>\n<span>Or c) travelled by train to work?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Oh, that's easy. I'm going to go for c) travelled by train to work.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, we'll find out later whether you're right or not. Now let's listen to a commuter in Nairobi who takes a matatu to get to work. These are minibuses used as shared taxis in East Africa. Can you spot a word that means being quick to notice things going on around you?</span>\n<span><strong>INSERT<br/>Commuter, Nairobi, Kenya<br/></strong></span>\n<span>When I'm stuck in the matatu there is a lot of strange things happen around you, so you have to be alert in Nairobi. When you open… when you leave your window open somebody can run away with your belongings. You may be speaking… using the phone… somebody just snatch your phone… you may expect the unexpected!  </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>The word used by this commuter in Kenya is <strong>alert</strong>. And in these noisy, crowded buses you need to be alert in case someone runs away with your belongings – <strong>belongings</strong> are the things that you own.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Right. Somebody might snatch your phone – <strong>snatch</strong> means to take something quickly. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Public transport in Nairobi sounds stressful! If I was taking the bus I'd want to have a <strong>nap</strong> – or short sleep.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. Well, people have done research on commuting and stress levels – and interestingly women are more likely to experience stress during their journey than men. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Why's that? </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, they're more likely to do something which is being called 'trip chaining' – where they make one or more stops on the way to work or going home – for example to drop off or pick up the kids from school – and this makes it more likely that something will go wrong with their journey.  </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Even if you aren't trip chaining it's no fun being stuck in a <strong>traffic jam</strong> – that's a large number of vehicles ​close together ​moving ​slowly – or being packed into a crowded train like sardines. Let's face it – travelling by car or by public transport can be really miserable! </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes.<strong> Packed in like sardines</strong> describes people standing so close together that they can't move – like fish in a can! So let's hear how longer commutes can affect your health from US researcher Christine Hoehner.</span>\n<span><strong>INSERT<br/>Christine Hoehner, researcher at Washington University School of Medicine<br/></strong></span>\n<span>My study found that adults who commuted longer distances from home to work were less physically active, less physically fit, weighed more and had higher blood pressure than those people who had shorter commutes.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>The American researcher must be talking about commuters who aren't engaged in active travel, mustn't she? Because if you cycle a longer distance then you're being more physically active.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I think you're right, for once, Neil!</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yeah. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And I'd better start going to the gym more. I don't like the sound of high blood pressure. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Why don't you hop on your bike, Alice? Then we can both wear lycra to work.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That's a fantastic idea, Neil! Moving on! Here's the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: What did the word 'commuter' originally describe? Was it someone who… a) travelled with other people? b) paid a reduced fare to travel? Or c) travelled by train to work?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And I said c) travelled by train to work. It must be right.</span>\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">And you were wrong I'm afraid, Neil! It's b) someone who paid a reduced fare to travel. The Oxford Dictionary says the word 'commute' comes from Latin <em>commutare</em>, from <em>com-</em> 'altogether' + <em>mutare</em> 'to change'. The word was used in the US in the 1840s, when people paid a reduced or <strong>commuted</strong> fare to travel by rail from the suburbs into the city.</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK. Can you tell us the words we heard today again, Alice?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Of course I can. Here they are:<br/></span>\n<span>foldaway bike<br/></span>\n<span>lycra<br/></span>\n<span>intrigued<br/></span>\n<span>commuting<br/></span>\n<span>the Tube<br/></span>\n<span>alert<br/></span>\n<span>belongings<br/></span>\n<span>snatch<br/></span>\n<span>nap<br/></span>\n<span>traffic jam<br/></span>\n<span>packed in like sardines<br/></span>\n<span>commuted</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that's the end of today's journey with 6 Minute English.

I'm Neil…</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>… and I'm Alice. Neil, what are you eating?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Peanuts.</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hmm. Did you know that one of the producers, here, has an allergy to peanuts?  </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>No, I didn't – but they're not in the studio with us, so it doesn't matter, does it?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>It only takes a tiny piece of peanut to cause a big allergic reaction in some people. An <strong>allergy</strong> by the way, is a condition that makes you feel ill after eating, touching or breathing in a particular substance. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And food allergies are the subject of today's show. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Alright, put your peanuts down, Neil and answer today's quiz question. What substance is used to treat a severe allergic reaction? Is it…<br/></span>\n<span>a) penicillin?<br/></span>\n<span>b) adrenalin?<br/></span>\n<span>Or c) aspirin?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK, well, I'm going to go for a) penicillin.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, we'll find out if that's the right answer later on. Now let's listen to Dr Marianne Williams talking about why being too clean may not be a good thing. She is a dietician here in the UK.</span>\n<span><strong>INSERT<br/>Dr Marianne Williams, gastroenterology dietician, UK<br/></strong></span>\n<span>For roughly the first month of life the immune system is switched off in essence and everything they [babies] get exposed to in that first month in life – dogs, cats, aunts, uncles, grannies, grandpas, family, dirt – everything – that is where they build up all the bacteria that are then going to colonise their gut in the future. Now, if you're born into a very sterile environment, as is increasingly the case in the western world, everything's kept terribly clean, and one of the theories is that we just are not getting enough exposure to a variety of bacteria at that very very early stage in that first month of life.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Dr Marianne Williams. The <strong>immune system</strong> is our body's defence against infection. And it's <strong>switched off</strong> – or not working – for the first month of a baby's life.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And through exposure to lots of things in our environment – that's family, pets, dirt and so on – young babies meet different bacteria for the first time which <strong>colonise</strong> – or live and grow in – their guts.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, but in a sterile environment babies don't <strong>get</strong> <strong>exposed to </strong>– or don't meet – a wide enough variety of bacteria.<strong> Sterile</strong> means completely clean and free of bacteria. And there's a theory that being too clean and bacteria-free – now we have soap, antibiotics and better sanitation – has lead to an increase in allergies.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So dirty play for babies is good – mud, pets, picking stuff up off the floor and eating it.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Did you use to eat food off the floor when you were little, Neil?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Used to? I still do. I enjoy food from the floor! </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, Neil, what can I say? We're both lucky to be allergy-free. I have a friend who has an allergy to <strong>gluten</strong> – a protein found in wheat and some other grains – and she has to be very careful about what she eats so she doesn't get ill.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>The supermarkets are quite helpful, though, aren't they, with products 'free from this' and 'free from that'? </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>This is helpful, yes. But the food industry is now marketing their products to attract consumers who don't have a <strong>proven</strong> – or tested – allergy. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Why would you buy free-from foods if you don't have a food allergy? </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, people have started to believe that certain foods – like gluten or dairy – are bad for us, though there isn't any medical evidence to support this. Let's hear about how <strong>rickets</strong> – a disease caused by a lack of Vitamin D in the diet – is affecting some children in the UK. This is BBC reporter Mike Williams.</span>\n<span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Mike Williams,</strong> <strong>BBC reporter<br/></strong>R</span>\n<span>ickets is common in the developing world but this is London in the 21st </span>\n<span>century. These children aren't malnourished because they're too poor to eat well – it's the opposite. Their often middle-class parents are spending money to give them foods with ingredients taken out. It's as if some of us have become unnecessarily frightened of our food.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Rickets usually affects <strong>malnourished </strong>childrenfrom poor countries– children who don't have enough to eat – and it makes their bones weak. But here in London some parents are buying their children expensive free-from foods – for example to avoid dairy – and are sometimes making them very ill.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>It sounds crazy, doesn't it? </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yeah… it's <strong>nuts</strong>! Get it? Nuts.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Very good.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. Nuts - that means crazy. Now I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK, then. So earlier in the show I asked: What substance is used to treat a severe allergic reaction? Is it… a) penicillin?  b) adrenalin?  Or c) aspirin?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I said a) penicillin.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And you were wrong, Neil! The correct answer is b) adrenalin. An injection of adrenalin can be used to treat <strong>anaphylaxis</strong> – or severe allergic reactions – to insect stings, foods, drugs, and other allergens. Antibiotics such as penicillin treat bacterial infections and aspirin is a painkiller you might take for a headache.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span>\n<span>OK, can you tell us the words we heard today again please, Alice?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Sure. They are:<br/></span>\n<span>allergy<br/></span>\n<span>immune system<br/></span>\n<span>switched off<br/></span>\n<span>colonise<br/></span>\n<span>get exposed to<br/></span>\n<span>sterile<br/></span>\n<span>gluten<br/></span>\n<span>proven<br/></span>\n<span>rickets<br/></span>\n<span>malnourished<br/></span>\n<span>nuts<br/></span>\n<span>anaphylaxis</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Are you ready for the quiz question?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>[makes some chimp noises]</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK, I'll assume that means yes. Right. What's another word for sleepwalking? Is it…<br/></span>\n<span>a) narcolepsy?<br/></span>\n<span>b) restless legs syndrome?<br/></span>\n<span>or c) somnambulism?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I will go for b) restless legs syndrome, since there's a connection there with the legs. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well we'll find out whether you're right or wrong later on in the show. So what keeps you awake at night, Neil?  </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Not much, to be honest. I usually <strong>sleep like a log</strong> – and that means very heavily indeed! But sometimes my own snoring wakes me up, and then I can find it hard to get back to sleep. <strong>Snoring</strong>, for those of you who don't know, means breathing in a noisy way through your mouth or nose while you're asleep. [snores] … like that… How about you, Alice?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Very good, yes. Well, that's quite ridiculous! Anyway, for me, it's drinking too much coffee during the day. It's the <strong>caffeine</strong> in coffee – a chemical that makes you feel more awake – which can stop you from sleeping at night. But there are so many things that can keep us awake these days. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Oh yes. Radio, TV… techy stuff like 24-hour internet, computers, smart phones. I love my phone and it's never far from me!</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, let's hear what Professor Jerome Siegel, from the University of California, found when he studied the sleep habits of three different hunter-gatherer communities who have very little contact with modern society. They don't have artificial light, electricity, batteries, or any of the gadgets that we rely on today.</span>\n<strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong>\n<span><strong>Professor Jerome Siegel, from the University of California, US<br/></strong></span>\n<span>Their sleep was not that different from ours. The range of sleep period was about 6.9 to 8.5 hours. If you actually measure sleep in current populations in the United States or in Europe they're definitely at the low end of what's been reported. They certainly don't sleep a lot less than we do but they clearly don't sleep more.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Professor Jerome Siegel found that people in these communities don't go to bed until several hours after sundown – just like us! But one big difference is that very few of them suffer from <strong>insomnia</strong> – which means having difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Now, I don't have a problem with insomnia. And <strong>hunter-gatherers</strong> – people who live by hunting animals and gathering plants to eat – don't either – probably because they take a lot of physical exercise during the day.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, that's right. Taking exercise is an important factor in sleeping <strong>soundly</strong> – or well – at night. But these days our minds can be so active that it becomes very difficult to fall asleep. Let's listen to Professor Kevin Morgan, from Loughborough University here in England, talking about how cognitive behavioural therapy can be used to help people with insomnia.</span>\n<span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Professor Kevin Morgan, Loughborough University, England<br/></strong></span>\n<span>If you have a train of thoughts which would otherwise keep you awake one way of dealing with this is to block those thoughts. What I'd like you to do is repeat the word 'the' in your mind at irregular intervals – the the the the the the the the the – what you'll find (is) that the mind space required to do this blocks out almost everything else.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So Professor Kevin Morgan suggests saying one word over and over again at irregular intervals – <strong>irregular</strong> in this context means not spaced out evenly. Doing it can help to block out the thoughts that are stopping you from getting to sleep. It sounds like a very simple solution. I wonder if it works?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>There's one way to find out, Neil. Try it yourself!</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I will.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK. And <strong>cognitive behavioural therapy</strong> by the way is a treatment for mental health problems that tries to change the way you think.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, I usually count sheep if I can't get to sleep. Do you do that, Alice?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>No, not usually. No. OK, I think it's time for the answer to our quiz question. I asked: What's another word for sleepwalking? Is it… a) narcolepsy? b) restless legs syndrome? or c) somnambulism?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said b) restless legs syndrome.</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Sorry, Neil, it's actually c) somnambulism – the roots of this word come from Latin. <em>Somnus</em> means 'sleep' and and <em>ambulare</em> means 'walk'. Narcolepsy is a condition where you can't stop yourself falling asleep, especially during the day. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Narcolepsy… (says in a sleepy way)</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And restless legs syndrome is a condition that makes you desperate to move your legs around, especially when you're sitting quietly or trying to get to sleep. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>… get to sleep… (murmuring)</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Neil! Wake up! </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Oh, hello Alice! Sorry.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Hello! Can we hear today's words again, please? </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK, yeah:<br/></span>\n<span>sleep like a log<br/></span>\n<span>snoring<br/></span>\n<span>caffeine<br/></span>\n<span>insomnia<br/></span>\n<span>hunter-gatherers<br/></span>\n<span>soundly<br/></span>\n<span>irregular<br/></span>\n<span>cognitive behavioural therapy</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that just about brings us to the end of this edition of 6 Minute English.

I'm Neil…</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>… and I'm Alice. Now Neil, I'm a big fan of chat shows, as you know. But what do you think makes a good interview?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I like it when the interviewer asks a question that <strong>catches</strong> the guest <strong>off guard</strong>. You know – to surprise them so they're embarrassed and don't know what to say. </span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's not very nice! </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I know. But it's great TV. That's what chat shows are all about, isn't it?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, I don't agree, Neil! A <strong>chat show</strong>, by the way, is a TV or radio programme where a <strong>host</strong> – the person who presents the show – talks to guest celebrities about various topics. And what makes a good interview is the subject of today's show. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So what's a good interview technique, Alice?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, asking <strong>open questions</strong> – questions the celebrities can't easily respond to with a short answer. Open questions give them the chance to talk and possibly reveal some juicy details about themselves!</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span><strong>Juicy details </strong>means information you find interesting because it's exciting or shocking. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. So let's test your interviewing skills, Neil. Ask me something – see if you can get some juicy details. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK… Hmm… How much do you weigh?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>How much do I weigh? </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yeah.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>How much do <em>you</em> weigh? Look, that's a <strong>closed question</strong> – you're going to get a short answer and no juicy details! And more importantly, Neil, it's a rude question!</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK – bad choice. Sorry. But your reaction was juicy – you got pretty <strong>hot under the collar</strong> – and that means embarrassed or angry! I'll try to think of a better question to ask you before the end of the show.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Alright then. Now, since you aren't good at <em>asking</em> questions, perhaps you can <em>answer</em> one instead. Who developed a method of questioning around two and a half thousand years ago that aims to discover hidden truths? Was it…<br/></span>\n<span>a) Hippocrates?<br/></span>\n<span>b) Socrates?<br/></span>\n<span>Or c) Aristotle?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, I don't know much about ancient history so I'm going to guess c) Aristotle.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, we'll find out if you picked the right answer later on – but now let's listen to Larry King talking about the secret of his successful career as a TV chat show host. Can you spot a word that means to get or produce?</span>\n<span><strong>INSERT<br/>Larry King, TV chat show host, US<br/></strong></span>\n<span>If you ask good questions and you elicit thoughtful answers then you learn more about the person. If the interview's hard – if I begin by saying, 'Why did you do that?' I'd make you defensive. That may be thrilling television, but you don't learn a lot. I learned that the more I drew back, asked good questions, listened to the answers, cared about the guest … you make the camera disappear.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>The word Larry King used is… <strong>elicit</strong>. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Right. And <em>you</em> elicited a defensive reaction from me when you asked a not very thoughtful question about my weight. <strong>Defensive</strong> means protecting yourself from criticism or attack. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK, I wouldn't make a good chat show host then.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>You're right there. So good interviewers <strong>draw back</strong> – or move away – from being the centre of attention. They're good listeners and care about their guests. Sound familiar? </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Are you suggesting that you're a good interviewer?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yup.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK, well, so why aren't you a top chat show host, hmm? What does Larry mean when he says you have to<strong> make the camera disappear</strong>?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>It means to make the conversation real – as if you were chatting with a friend – rather than performing to a TV audience. But let's hear more from Larry King on the secret of his success.</span>\n<strong><span>INSERT</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span><strong>Larry King, TV chat show host, US<br/></strong></span>\n<span>I don't want a 'no'. I don't want a 'yes'. I want a 'why'. So in other words, I want to be a little kind of dumb. My friend Herbie said the secret of my success is being dumb. 'What do you mean by that?' </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So you have to ask <strong>dumb</strong> – or stupid – questions to make a great chat show host! I knew it!</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Maybe there's hope for you yet, Neil.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Charming.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Lovely. OK, here's the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: Who developed a method of questioning around two and a half thousand years ago that aims to discover hidden truths? Was it… a) Hippocrates? b) Socrates? Or c) Aristotle?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And I said c) Aristotle.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>No, it was b) Socrates. All three were famous Greek philosophers but Socrates was the one who angered lots of important people by his <strong>probing</strong> – or investigative – questions – and this technique is called Socratic Dialogue. Socrates lived from 469 to 399 BC and he influenced philosophy so much that all previous thinkers have come to be known as Pre-Socratic. Despite this he declared \"All I know is that I know nothing\".</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Very noble. OK, a final question for you, Alice. What makes you happy? </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Working with such a fantastic co-presenter, Neil. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That's nice! I'm embarrassed now.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Can you tell us the words we heard today?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Of course!<br/></span>\n<span><br/></span>\n<span>catch somebody off guard<br/></span>\n<span>chat show<br/></span>\n<span>host<br/></span>\n<span>open questions<br/></span>\n<span>juicy details<br/></span>\n<span>closed question<br/></span>\n<span>hot under the collar<br/></span>\n<span>elicit<br/></span>\n<span>defensive<br/></span>\n<span>draw back<br/></span>\n<span>make the camera disappear<br/></span>\n<span>dumb<br/></span>\n<span>probing</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, do indeed!<br/></span>\n<span><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye.</span>"

I'm Neil…<br/><br/></span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>… and I'm Alice. Have you er… gained some weight, Neil? You're not looking in great shape…</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm afraid so! My New Year's resolution is to <strong>get in shape</strong> – or to get fit through physical exercise. I look fat, don't I?</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well… er… Did you overindulge during the Christmas holidays, Neil?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I'm afraid I did, Alice. <strong>Overindulge</strong> means to have too much of something nice – like all that lovely Christmas food!</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, lovely. Why do you think appearance is so important to us, Neil? Getting in shape is a very popular <strong>New Year's resolution </strong>– that's a decision to do or stop doing something at the beginning of the New Year.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Good question. Well, I think we all judge people according to the way they look. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>The subject of today's show is <strong>appearance</strong> or the way we look. Did you know Neil that better-looking people tend to be judged by others as more intelligent?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That sounds unfair!</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I know. Well, show us you aren't just a pretty face by getting today's quiz question right. From a study done in the UK, which physical aspect of their appearance were men most likely to say was their favourite? Was it…<br/></span>\n<span>a) their hair?<br/></span>\n<span>b) their face?<br/></span>\n<span>Or c) their height?<br/><br/></span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK, I'm going for a) hair. I like my hair.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>You have lovely hair, Neil.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Thank you.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And a lot of it.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Anyway, we'll find out later whether you're right or not. Now, it's not only people who make quick decisions about others based on the way they look. Some animals do this too. Peahens – that's a female peacock - prefer male peacocks with lots of eyespots on their tail.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Why's that?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, one theory is that a male peacock's tail is a sign of his genes. <strong>Genes</strong> are part of the DNA in a cell that controls the physical development and behaviour of an animal. It takes lots of energy to grow a big tail, and to carry it around, so only the strongest, healthiest males can afford to do this.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So what do men need in order to attract women, Alice? </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>A deep voice and a square jaw, according to research.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, let's listen now to fashion historian Amber Butchart describing what men used to do to <strong>enhance</strong> – or improve – their physical appearance. </span>\n<span><strong>INSERT<br/>Amber Butchart, fashion historian and analyst<br/></strong></span>\n<span>Men quite often would wear corsets throughout [the] 18<sup>th</sup> Century even into the 19<sup>th</sup> Century. It was possibly concerned with displaying status and rank rather than what we now define as physical attractiveness but I think the two were very bound up together. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>This was Amber Butchart. A <strong>corset</strong> is a tight-fitting piece of underwear that squeezes you in and makes your waist look smaller.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I didn't know men used to wear corsets! That might make you talk in a high voice – and that wouldn't be very attractive, would it?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, no, Neil. It's a very interesting look and sound for you… On a more serious note, Amber says that men weren't wearing these uncomfortable <strong>garments</strong> – or clothes – just to look more physically attractive – they were also doing it to display their status and rank.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span><strong>Status</strong> means the professional or social position of a person in relation to others. And <strong>rank</strong> is another way of saying the same thing. Do you think we still dress to impress, Alice – or are things a bit freer than they were in the 18<sup>th</sup> Century? I'm a jeans and T-shirt man, as you know. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well yes, indeed, you don't have to be <strong>suited and booted</strong> for our job – and that means smartly dressed. But I think the way we dress is still important. But for women, particularly, I think we dress nicely for ourselves – not for anybody else. Sometimes I put on make-up – not because I'm going out – but because it makes me feel good.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>You always look nice – with or without make-up, Alice.<br/><br/></span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Thank you, Neil! That's very nice. But let's listen now to academic Philippa Dietrich from the University of the West of England, Bristol, talking about valuing ourselves for all our attributes – not just our appearance.<br/><br/></span>\n<span><strong>INSERT<br/>Philippa Dietrich, University of the West of England, Bristol<br/></strong></span>\n<span>This focus just on appearance – on looks – really sends people the ideas that their bodies are just objects to be looked at. Having a belief system or focussing on your values in life or other attributes or personality characteristics or interests or anything else that's not to do with appearance is really important. Our bodies are not there to be looked that – they have functions.<br/><br/></span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>What Philippa Dietrich said makes sense to me. We need to focus on our inner beauty. What do you think, Alice?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, I think you should stop posting selfies on social media then, Neil! Now here's the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: From a study done in the UK, which physical aspect of their appearance were men most likely to say was their favourite? Was it… a) their hair? b) their face? Or c) their height?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And I said a) hair. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And you were wrong I'm afraid, Neil! It's c) height. A poll conducted by ComRes for BBC Radio found that when it comes to appearance, men were most likely to mention their height - 21% of them in fact said it was their favourite physical attribute whereas for women, 35% of them said their hair was their favourite thing. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, forget about my hair, Alice - I'm tall too, OK, so… you can tell us the words we heard today, please?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Here they are:<br/></span>\n<span>get in shape<br/></span>\n<span>overindulge<br/></span>\n<span>New Year's resolution<br/></span>\n<span>appearance<br/></span>\n<span>genes<br/></span>\n<span>corset<br/></span>\n<span>garments<br/></span>\n<span>status<br/></span>\n<span>rank<br/></span>\n<span>suited and booted</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Happy New Year everyone and we hope you keep your New Year's resolutions! Please join us again soon.</span>\n<span><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye.</span>"

I'm Alice…</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil… Did you get all your Christmas shopping done, Alice?</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I did, Neil. And I spent <strong>a small fortune</strong> – and that means a lot of money!</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, I hate buying all those presents that people just don't really want. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Oh, Neil, you grumpy old Scrooge! And I hope you realise that the subject of today's show is Christmas kindness!</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Oh dear. I might be <strong>grumpy</strong> – and that means bad-tempered – but I'm not a scrooge! I don't mind spending money – I just don't know what to buy people. Ebenezer Scrooge is the main character in Charles Dickens' novel <em>A Christmas Carol</em>. He's a <strong>miser</strong> – and that means someone who loves money but hates spending it. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Indeed. Well, on the subject of <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, Neil, at the end of the story, what does Scrooge buy the Cratchit family for Christmas dinner? Is it…<br/></span>\n<span>a) a goose?<br/></span>\n<span>b) a turkey?<br/></span>\n<span>Or c) a chicken?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Hmm. Well, I haven't read the book so I'm going to guess a) a goose. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, we'll find out later if you chose the right answer. Now, Neil, I agree that Christmas shopping can sometimes feel pointless – but we mustn't forget what a magical time Christmas is for young children. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that's true. I remember how hard it was to get to sleep on Christmas Eve – worrying that Santa Claus would get stuck in our chimney. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, well,<strong> eve</strong> means the day before something – in this case, Christmas Day. Parents tell their children that <strong>Santa Claus</strong> – an imaginary old man with a white beard and red clothes – will bring them presents at Christmas time. In the UK children believe that Santa comes down the chimney to get into the house.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>But it's not all fun. Increasing numbers of people these days are struggling for money at this time of year. Having enough food to feed their family is what matters most and buying presents comes further down the list. So let's listen now to a BBC Scotland report by Laura Maxwell. She's talking about a special event with lots of presents.</span>\n<span><strong>INSERT<br/>Laura Maxwell, BBC Scotland, and Beatrice Caddell<br/></strong></span>\n<span><strong>LM:</strong> Beatrice Cadell has just celebrated her 80</span>\n<span><sup><span>th </span></sup></span>\n<span>birthday. And instead of presents for her, she asked her friends to buy toys. <br/></span>\n<span><strong>BC:</strong> Everyone that turned up to that birthday do was absolutely brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. And it's good for something like this. It's even better. It's even better – you know – somebody else can benefit. We don't need it. We're old. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So Beatrice is celebrating her birthday and she told friends and family to buy toys instead of presents for her.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Right. She had the generous idea of <strong>donating</strong> – or giving – the toys to a <strong>toy bank</strong> – a place where toys are given away free to people in need. The toy bank then distributed Beatrice's toys to parents who couldn't afford to buy presents for their children at Christmas.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. So Beatrice is happy that children can <strong>benefit</strong> – or be helped by her. She says she doesn't need presents. A woman <strong>after your own heart</strong>, Neil!</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Indeed! And that means Beatrice has the same opinion as me! Well, that's a great example of Christmas charity – and <strong>charity</strong> means giving free help to people who need it. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. And here's another example, Neil. Last year in London, twenty tons of presents were donated, wrapped, and delivered to a local hospital to cheer up sick children who couldn't go home for Christmas.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Were they delivered in Santa's sleigh?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>No Neil, they were delivered in a big double-decker bus! Let's hear about the volunteers who made this happen. </span>\n<strong><span>INSERT<br/>Volunteer<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Lots of different groups of people come together under the banner of kindness – so religious people come together, corporate people come together, young people, old people – it seems to be something that stretches across many many many different demographics.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span><strong>Under the banner of kindness</strong> – what does that mean, Alice? </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well,<strong> being under the banner of something</strong> means being part of a group who are united in support for an idea. And in this case, different people came together to do something kind for sick children.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And demographics? What's that?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span><strong>Demographics</strong> means statistical information about a population and the groups of people in it. People from different groups in society are working together – the old and the young, religious people, corporate – or business – people.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And this talk of kindness is making me feel more in the mood for Christmas! </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I can see that, Ebenezer. You've got a smile on your face! Now, earlier in the show, I asked: At the end of the story, what does Scrooge buy the Cratchit family for Christmas dinner? Is it… a) a goose? b) a turkey? Or c) a chicken?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And I said a) a goose.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. And you were wrong, Neil! The answer is b) a turkey. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That makes me a goose.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>It certainly does. Scrooge buys the Cratchit family the prize turkey hanging. Delicious! <em>A Christmas Carol</em> is a lovely story. Everybody should read it.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And did you know that although turkeys are traditional Christmas food now, they weren't in Dickens's time.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I see...</span>\n<span> </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>They were <strong>exotic</strong> back then – and that means unusual because it comes from another country. The story was written in 1843. Now how about hearing the words we learned today, Alice?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>They are:<br/></span>\n<span>a small fortune<br/></span>\n<span>grumpy<br/></span>\n<span>miser<br/></span>\n<span>eve<br/></span>\n<span>Santa Claus<br/></span>\n<span>donating<br/></span>\n<span>toy bank<br/></span>\n<span>benefit<br/></span>\n<span>after your own heart<br/></span>\n<span>charity<br/></span>\n<span>under the banner of something<br/></span>\n<span>demographics<br/></span>\n<span>exotic</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Merry Christmas, everybody! </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Merry Christmas!</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Please join us again soon!</span>\n<span><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye.</span>"

    "description": "Some people actively embrace risk by jumping out of aeroplanes, scuba-diving or motor-racing. But we all face risks every day by eating, drinking, walking and driving – simply going about our daily lives carries all sorts of unseen threats. And yet for some reason we don’t judge these risks accurately. Follow Alice and Finn's discussion and learn new words.\nWhat are your chances of being knocked off your bicycle and killed during a one-mile journey (and this is the same as your chances of winning the national lottery)? Is it…\n<br/>\n<br/>\na) 1 in 4 million?\n<br/>\n<br/>\nb) 1 in 14 million?\n<br/>\n<br/>\nc) 1 in 400 million?\nYou can hear the right answer at the end of the programme.\n<strong><span>phobia<br/></span></strong>\n<span>a strong and unreasonable fear of something</span>\n<strong><span>risk<br/></span></strong>\n<span>the chances of something bad happening</span>\n<strong><span>probability<br/></span></strong>\n<span>how likely something is to happen</span>\n<strong><span>gut reaction<br/></span></strong>\n<span>an instinctive emotional response</span>\n<strong><span>catastrophic<br/></span></strong>\n<span>something which causes a huge amount of damage and suffering</span>\n<span><strong>media coverage<br/></strong>reports about something in the News, newspapers, and the internet</span>\n<span><strong>chronic<br/></strong>something that lasts for a long time</span>\n<strong><span>thrill seekers<br/></span></strong>\n<span>people who enjoy taking part in extreme sports and other activities involving physical risk</span>\n<strong><span>base jumper<br/></span></strong>\n<span>a person with a parachute who leaps from tall buildings or cliffs</span>\nNote: This is not a word-for-word transcript\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice…</span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>… and I'm Finn. Hello.</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hello, Finn. You're off on holiday tomorrow, aren't you?</span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I am and you know, and I'm dreading it. I hate flying! </span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Do you? I didn't know you had a <strong>phobia</strong> – and that means a strong and unreasonable fear of something.  </span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well, I don't think this is a phobia because it isn't unreasonable. Flying thousands of feet up in the sky in a tin can, you know, that's not safe! </span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Flying is safer than you think, Finn. It's much riskier to drive or cycle to work. And, actually, risk taking is the subject of today's show! <strong>Risk</strong> means the chances of something bad happening. For example, did you know that your chance of being knocked off your bicycle and killed during a one-mile journey is the same as your chances of winning the lottery?</span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>You know Alice, I didn't know that. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And this leads me on to our quiz question for today: What are the odds … what are the chances of either of these two things happening? Is it…<br/></span>\n<span>a) 1 in 4 million?<br/></span>\n<span>b) 1 in 14 million?<br/></span>\n<span>Or c) 1 in 400 million?</span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I have no idea. I'll go with the big number: 1 in 400 million, c).</span>\n<span><strong>Alice </strong>OK. So we'll find out later if you're right or wrong later on. Now let's listen to Andreas Wilkey, a psychologist at Clarkson University in New York, talking about why we're bad at assessing risk. </span>\n<span><strong>INSERT </strong><strong>Andreas Wilkey, Psychologist, Clarkson University, Potsdam, New York<br/></strong></span>\n<span>People typically fear anything which is small probability but it's extremely catastrophic if it were to happen… Think about dying in a plane crash, think about a nuclear meltdown from the nearby power plant. Recently we have another increase in these birds' virus outbreaks in South Korea. People read about that. And they may pay a lot of attention to that in the news but they may forget to get their flu shot. </span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That was Andreas Wilkey from Clarkson University. And we heard that a small <strong>probability</strong> of something happening means it's unlikely to happen. But we worry about big or catastrophic events such as catching bird flu or dying in a plane crash because we have a <strong>gut</strong> <strong>reaction </strong>to them– in other words, we react emotionally. A <strong>catastrophic</strong> event is something that causes a huge amount of damage and suffering.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And it's often because of <strong>media coverage</strong> – for example, watching the news and reading the newspapers – that it can be difficult for us to understand how likely certain things are to happen. Catastrophic events feel like very real threats, while we tend to forget about the small but chronic risks that become more likely over time.</span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>We do.<strong> Chronic</strong> means something that lasts for a long time. So for example, what if there was a cigarette that killed you as soon as you smoked it? Nobody would do that, would they?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>No, they wouldn't.</span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>But plenty of people are happy to smoke for years, and put off worrying about the health risks for the future.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, that's a good point, Finn! People feel they are in control of risks that stretch over time. You know, they think, 'I could stop tomorrow' or 'I could smoke less'. But what about people who enjoy taking big risks – those <strong>thrill seekers</strong> out there? </span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>People who enjoy extreme sports actually seek out danger – it gives them extreme pleasure! So let's listen to Karina Hollekim from Norway. She's a <strong>base jumper</strong> – that's a person with a parachute who leaps from tall buildings or cliffs – and she's talking about what she feels about risk.</span>\n<span><strong>INSERT </strong><strong>Karina Hollekim, base jumper<br/></strong></span>\n<span>You need to measure the pleasure. Is it going to be worth it for you? So if the risk is really high, it means that the pleasure needs to be equally high. Or hopefully even higher… You can't measure it on a scale or anything. For me, it's a stomach feeling. It's the value within me, and I'm the only one who can tell what value it has to me. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. It must be a magical feeling to step off a cliff, mustn't it, Finn?</span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>'It's a stomach feeling', you know – my stomach would definitely be saying, 'oh no, no, no!' So why not change the subject and give me the answer to today's quiz question?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I asked: What are your chances of being knocked off your bicycle and killed during a one-mile journey and this is the same as your chances of winning the national lottery? So is it… a) 1 in 4 million? b) 1 in 14 million? Or c) 1 in 400 million?</span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I said c) 1 in 400 million.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. And you were wrong, Finn. </span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Alright. Really? OK.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. The odds are actually 1 in 14 million. You are as likely to win the national lottery from a single ticket as you are to be knocked off your bicycle and killed during a one-mile journey. This statistic comes from the Professor David Spiegelhalter, who is Winton Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk in the Statistical Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in the UK. So I think he really knows his stuff.</span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That's a very long title, yes, I'm sure he does. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yeah.</span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So let's hear today's words again, Alice?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Here they are:<br/></span>\n<span>phobia<br/></span>\n<span>risk<br/></span>\n<span>probability<br/></span>\n<span>gut reaction<br/></span>\n<span>catastrophic<br/></span>\n<span>media coverage<br/></span>\n<span>chronic<br/></span>\n<span>thrill seekers<br/></span>\n<span>base jumper<br/></span>\n<span>And that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.

You went to university, didn't you? </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. University – the best days of my life. I made fantastic friends, went to great parties…</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Did some work? </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, yeah, I did <em>some</em> work, but probably not enough.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, the subject of today's show is student mental health. So, Neil, do you think you're looking back at your university days <strong>through rose-tinted spectacles</strong>? And that means looking at a situation as being better than it really was.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I did feel out of my comfort zone when I arrived. Yes, everyone seemed to know everyone… knew where to go.</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, well, being<strong> out of your comfort zone </strong>means being in a situation that you aren't familiar with and which makes you feel nervous. Did you talk to anyone about your feelings, Neil? Did you get any <strong>counselling</strong>? And that means professional help with personal or psychological problems.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What? No, not me. I'm one of those men who isn't good at talking about their feelings, Alice. I just felt a bit <strong>homesick</strong> that's all – I missed my friends and family. But let's move on, shall we! Why don't you ask me today's quiz question? </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Alright then. So here it is: In a survey of students at Imperial College London, how many students said they suffered from high levels of stress or a mental health condition during their time at college? Was it…<br/></span>\n<span>a) 1 out of 4?<br/></span>\n<span>b) 2 out of 4?<br/></span>\n<span>or c) 3 out of 4?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, I'm going to go for c) 3 out of 4 because I do think that university life can be more stressful than people realize.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. And <strong>stress</strong> means pressure or worry caused by a difficult situation. OK, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. Now in the UK, there has been a rise in students using counselling services.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Why's that, Alice? </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, let's listen to Kirsty, a student at Exeter University, talking about why she has had problems. And here's a question for you while you listen: Did she enjoy her first days in college?</span>\n<strong><span>INSERT</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span><strong>Kirsty McMurron, student at Exeter University<br/></strong></span>\n<span>No. The thing is… it… is a real balancing act. When I first got to university I don't think I'd really realized that I'd forgotten how to make friends you know, I'd been with the same school friends for seven years, and so I was trying to balance you know social success with academic success whilst learning how to look after myself at quite a young age. And I think that's the experience of a lot of young people. And people really struggle with it.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>What's a <strong>balancing act</strong>, Alice?</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It's where you try to give your attention to two or more things at the same time. So here, Kirsty is trying to balance making new friends with doing her academic work and learning to look after herself.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>What does Kirsty mean when she says she's learning to look after herself?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, to <strong>look after someone</strong> means to protect or take care of someone – and in this case, Kirsty's learning to take care of herself – for example doing her own shopping and cooking. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK, let's listen to Dr Ruth Caleb of the counselling service at Brunel University in London talking about what practical stuff students could learn before leaving for university that might make life easier for them.</span>\n<span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Dr Ruth Caleb, Head of the counselling service at Brunel University, London<br/></strong></span>\n<span>Certain things that I think it would be very very helpful for students to have put in place are an ability to do the practical things of life – to do the washing, to do the cleaning and so on – being able to cook. Budgeting is extremely important in university life. And also spending time on your own comfortably.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, that's excellent advice. I couldn't boil an egg when I arrived at uni.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>Oh, really? Can you do it now, Neil? </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Just about, just about.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yeah? Great. And what about <strong>budgeting</strong>? This means planning how much money you have and how you will spend it.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>I'm still pretty bad at that. However, I am very good at spending time on my own comfortably. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, I can believe that – feet up, watching TV with a takeaway. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Takeaway, of course a takeaway cause I can't cook anything…</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>No.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>… not even an egg. You know me so well. So how about the answer to today's quiz question, Alice?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Alright then. I asked: In a survey of students at Imperial College London, how many said they suffered from high levels of stress or a mental health condition during their time at college? Was it…<br/></span>\n<span>a) 1 out of 4?<br/></span>\n<span>b) 2 out of 4?<br/></span>\n<span>or c) 3 out of 4?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said c) 3 out of 4.</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. And you are correct – well done, Neil! The survey, completed by over a thousand students, also found that almost 70% of those that suffer from stress do so at least once a week, and 9% of students feel <strong>stressed</strong> constantly. Stressed means anxious and worried.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I feel anxious just thinking about all that stress. Can we hear today's words again?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>We certainly can. They are:<br/></span>\n<span>through rose-tinted spectacles<br/></span>\n<span>out of your comfort zone<br/></span>\n<span>counselling<br/></span>\n<span>homesick<br/></span>\n<span>stress<br/></span>\n<span>balancing act<br/></span>\n<span>look after yourself<br/></span>\n<span>budgeting<br/></span>\n<span>stressed</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice…\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\n… and I'm Neil. Hello.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nHello, Neil. Now what do you know about Robin Hood?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nOK. Well, he wore green tights…\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, he did.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nHe was good at archery… he had a girlfriend called Maid Marion. He was English – although he sometimes he has an American accent in Hollywood films.\n<strong>Alice<br/></strong>\nYes.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nThere was a great Disney cartoon series using animal characters. Robin and Maid Marion were foxes.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nAnything else? What about being an outlaw or criminal? Heroically fighting against injustice and corruption?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nOh yeah, there's all that stuff as well – robbing the rich and giving to the poor. Yes, yeah… he lived in Sherwood Forest with a band of merry men.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, he did. OK, it sounds like you've watched a lot of TV and film versions but haven't read the literature.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nOh, come on, Alice! Have you read the literature?\n<strong>Alice<br/></strong>\nYes I have. I studied English at university and one of my specialist subjects was medieval literature. The Middle Ages or medieval period lasted in Europe from the 5th to the 15th century.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nI see. And I'm guessing that Robin Hood is the subject of today's show?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely. You're right! So here's a question for you, Neil: When do we find the first reference to Robin Hood in English literature? Was it in the…\n<br/>\na) 5th century?\n<br/>\nb) 10th century?\n<br/>\nOr c) 14th century?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, I'm going to go for the middle one – and that's b) 10th century.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nOK. Well, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. Now, why do you think the stories of Robin Hood have lasted from the Middle Ages through to the modern day?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, I suppose it's got appeal on lots of levels – action, adventure – there's some comedy stuff there with the merry men. And of course, romance, like I said before.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, indeed. Actually the early versions of Robin Hood were very violent. Let's listen to Professor Thomas Hahn talk about one of the ballads called The Monk.\n<strong>INSERT</strong>\n<br/>\n<strong>Thomas Hahn, Professor of English Literature at the University of Rochester, New York<br/></strong>\nThe Monk is, I think for most modern audiences who've either seen movies or read children's stories or whatever, quite disturbing in terms of its levels of violence. In terms of trying to make some comparisons with popular culture it seems to me that it's really at the level of Sopranos in terms of things like dismembered bodies and actual violence and assassinations.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWhat's a ballad, Alice?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, It's a song or poem that tells a story. People were telling the stories of Robin Hood for a long time before they were written down – and performing them too.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nReally? And how about the comparison between the Robin Hood ballads and the Sopranos? Now The Sopranos is a popular US TV series about gangsters. Maybe I should get The Monk on audiobook. What do you think?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, I don’t think you'd find it disturbing – disturbing means making you feel upset or shocked. Assassinations are the murder of important people, often for political reasons. And dismembered bodies are bodies that have been cut or torn into pieces.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nRight. It sounds like medieval entertainment for guys. You know, like martial arts movies these days.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, yes, you may be right. Now do you remember you mentioned Maid Marion at the start of the show?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nI do.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, actually, in the early ballads there is no Maid Marian. She appears in later versions along with other characters we know well today. But Robin is always a trickster, and a man with a bow in a wood.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nA trickster is someone who deceives or cheats people. That's impressive, Alice. You certainly know your medieval ballads.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, I do. So what's so appealing about this man with a bow? Let's listen to Professor Hahn again.\n<strong>INSERT</strong>\n<br/>\n<strong>Thomas Hahn, Professor of English Literature at the University of Rochester, New York<br/></strong>\nWhat he represents I think is a kind of strong and forceful masculinity that operates on its own terms and for its own interests and that's I think what we admire in these stories.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWhat does it mean to operate on your own terms, Alice?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, Neil, it means to do what you want according to your own rules. And masculinity means the qualities typical of a man. Now, remember my question from earlier? I asked: When do we find the first reference to Robin Hood in English literature? Was it in the…\n<br/>\na) 5th century?\n<br/>\nb) 10th century?\n<br/>\nOr c) 14th century?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd I said b) 10th century.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, well… I'm afraid you are wrong, Neil. The first reference occurs in the English poet William Langland's book Piers Plowman written between 1370 and 1390. Sloth, the lazy priest, says: \"I kan not parfitly my Paternoster as the preest it singeth,/ But I kan rymes of Robyn Hood and Randolf Erl of Chestre.\"\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, Alice, can you translate that into modern English, please? Maybe that's for another show.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nMaybe another show…\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nCan we just have today's words again, please?\n<strong>Alice<br/></strong>\nWe certainly can. And we can have those in modern English. OK. Here they are:\n<br/>\noutlaw\n<br/>\nmedieval period or Middle Ages\n<br/>\nballad\n<br/>\ndisturbing\n<br/>\nassassinations\n<br/>\ndismembered bodies\n<br/>\ntrickster\n<br/>\noperate on your own terms\n<br/>\nmasculinity\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English. We hope you enjoyed today's walk in the woods. Please do join us again soon.\n<strong>Both</strong>\n<br/>\nBye."

I'm Alice…</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>… and I'm Neil. Hello.</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hello, Neil. Now tell me, do you usually go dutch when you take someone out to dinner?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now <strong>go dutch</strong> means to share the cost of something, for example a meal in a restaurant. Well Alice, no, I usually expect my date to pay actually. </span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I hope you're joking, Neil. But I wouldn’t be surprised! Personally, I think it's a nice gesture to offer to pay for the meal when you're on a date. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah. But it can depend on the situation – some people might be very offended if you offered to pay for everything! </span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well yes, true. Clearly you're not going to offend those people, Neil, though are you? And I won’t be going to dinner with you any time soon. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I didn't ask so calm down, Alice! Actually, money matters can cause relationship problems in couples – and that's the subject of the show. Here's today's quiz question based on a UK survey. Ready, Alice?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I am indeed.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>What percentage of married couples don't know exactly what their spouse earns? Is it:<br/></span>\n<span>a) 4%?<br/></span>\n<span>b) 14%?<br/></span>\n<span>Or c) 44%</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, gosh! I think b) 14%. Yes, that sounds about right to me.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. Now, it seems important that couples are honest about their finances because it can have an impact on their future financial options together. </span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, that's right. If you're buying a house together and then find out later that your <strong>spouse</strong> – your husband or wife – is thousands of pounds in debt, then the chances are you won't be able to get a mortgage. <strong>To be in debt</strong>, by the way, means to owe money to someone.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Good point. A <strong>mortgage</strong> is where a bank lends you money to buy a house. Let's listen now to what Arabella Russell, a relationship therapist, has to say about this. </span>\n<span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Arabella Russell, relationship therapist<br/></strong></span>\n<span>The fact of the matter is it's very difficult – it can be very difficult – to talk about money. Often when we talk about money, it’s emotions very close to us – there's guilt, there's shame. What have we done in the past? To start those conversations is complicated. Money can be about how we value ourselves, how we feel valued. It’s not just a simple case of talking about hard cash. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Arabella talks about 'hard cash'. Now what does that mean? </span>\n<strong><span>Alice</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>Well, we say <strong>hard cash</strong> when we talk about physical money – the coins and banknotes – as opposed to other types of payment.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>And why do we find it so difficult to talk about cash, Alice?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, because we get emotional about it! Arabella talks about feelings of guilt and shame. And for many of us, money isn't simply money – it can be about how we value ourselves or feel valued.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Right – so if I were to buy you a cheap engagement ring you would feel undervalued.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Nice example, Neil! You can't be a cheapskate when it comes to engagement rings! So how much would you spend on our engagement ring, Neil?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well… um… I didn't know we were getting married!  But if I was buying an engagement ring for you Alice, I think definitely I would spend about… you know around... in the region of … mmm pounds… </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Sorry, Neil, I didn't quite catch that. Alright!</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Are you calling me a cheapskate?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I certainly am, Neil. <strong>Cheapskate</strong> means someone who doesn't like spending money, by the way. Moving on – let's hear more from Arabella about how people have different attitudes towards money.</span>\n<strong><span>INSERT</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<strong><span>Arabella Russell, relationship therapist<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Accept the fact that in your relationship you might do money differently – there might be a spender there might be a saver. It’s very tempting if your partner does things differently to say they're wrong. They might do it differently because they see money differently. Do it differently but have a budget. Of course be honest about each other but recognise that you might just have a different view of money.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now that sounds like excellent advice to me! I'm a saver, and I'm not ashamed to say it. Why waste money on an expensive engagement ring? Engagements don't always last. You might drop the ring down the kitchen sink or… </span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>How romantic, Neil! </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>… it could be stolen or you might meet someone else.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>Indeed. Now I know I shouldn't say you're wrong… but you're wrong! You have to invest in a relationship if you want it to work. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Calm down. I see money differently to you. I’m a saver and you’re a spender, and that’s all there is to it. And a <strong>budget</strong> means the money you have available for something and a plan for how to use it.</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll have to <strong>agree to differ</strong>. And that means accept that we have different opinions on this one! Can we have the answer to today's quiz question then, please?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, we can. I asked: What percentage of married couples don't know exactly what their spouse earns? Is it:<br/></span>\n<span>a) 4%?<br/></span>\n<span>b) 14%?<br/></span>\n<span>Or c) 44%</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And I said b) 14%.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you are absolutely and completely… wrong! The correct answer is 44%. Now that's according to new research conducted by the UK credit report service, Noddle, who also found that an astonishing 1.9 million married couples actively try to keep their finances secret from their partners!</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Gosh, what a lot of people! Can we have today's words again then, Neil, please?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, we can. Here they are:<br/></span>\n<span>go dutch<br/></span>\n<span>spouse<br/></span>\n<span>to be in debt<br/></span>\n<span>mortgage<br/></span>\n<span>hard cash<br/></span>\n<span>cheapskate<br/></span>\n<span>budget <br/></span>\n<span>agree to differ</span>\n<strong><span> </span></strong>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English. We hope you thought today's programme was good value. Please join us again soon. See you then.</span>\n<span><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye.</span>"

    "description": "The BBC is offering women around the world a voice to discuss the issues they care about. Catherine and Li talk about the programmes and debates about issues as diverse as the right of Indian women to use the toilet for free, to women who opt out of motherhood.\nHow many female heads of state or government do we have now, in 2015? Is it:\na) 9\nb) 19\nc) 29\nYou can hear the answer at the end of the programme.\n<strong><span>covered<br/></span></strong>\n<span>(here) talked about</span>\n<strong><span>childless<br/></span></strong>\n<span>without children</span>\n<strong><span>role<br/></span></strong>\n<span>(bere) the way you are expected to behave</span>\n<strong><span>discrimination<br/></span></strong>\n<span>unfair treatment of people who belong to different groups, e.g. male and female</span>\n<strong><span>at the core<br/></span></strong>\n<span>in the centre </span>\n<strong><span>pee<br/></span></strong>\n<span>urinate, pass water</span>\n<strong><span>sexism<br/></span></strong>\n<span>treating somebody unfairly because of their gender</span>\nNote: This is not a word-for-word transcript\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Catherine<br/></strong>\nHello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Catherine…\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Li<br/></strong>\n…and I'm Li. And today we are talking about women's rights. Catherine, do you think women's rights are well covered by the media?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Catherine<br/></strong>\n<strong>Covered</strong>\nmeans 'talked about'. And I would say it could be better, to be honest. Many women's magazines are all about beauty tips, fashion and how to please your man. Now, I'm interested in the real issues. One thing the media doesn't talk about much is what the role of childless women, like myself, is. And\n<strong>childless</strong>\nmeans 'having no children'.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Li<br/></strong>\nYes. In some societies, the\n<strong>role</strong>\nof women – role, the way they are expected to behave – is to have children. If they don't, it's like there's something wrong with them, and they are supposed to be unhappy.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Catherine<br/></strong>\nI have no children and I'm very happy. Anyway, women in various countries around the world want to discuss problems which are close to home. And that's why the BBC has organised a series of programmes to discuss some issues that affect half the world's population. The series is called 100 Women and it's the theme of this 6 Minute English.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Li<br/></strong>\nThe\n<strong>discrimination</strong>\nagainst women happens in different ways in different countries.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Catherine<br/></strong>\nDiscrimination means the unjust treatment of people who belong to different groups - in this case, male and female. Maybe Li, more women should be in positions of power. And that's what today's quiz question is about. Li, how many female heads of state or government do we have around the world now, in 2015? Is it:\na) 9\n<br/>\nb) 19 or\n<br/>\nc) 29\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Li<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Well, I'm going to guess… c) 29. </span>\n<strong>Catherine<br/></strong>\nThat's very optimistic and we'll find out later if you're right. Now, let's talk about the BBC's 100 Women season. The season will include programmes across all the BBC platforms – including radio, online, TV and social media. And the BBC's Tammi Walker is working on the social media offer. Here she is, explaining what audiences can expect.\n<strong><span>INSERT</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<strong><span>Tammi Walker, BBC social media producer for 100 Women<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Within the season we've got big debates. One is \"Is news failing women?\", which is obviously <strong>at the core</strong> of what we are trying to get to. And that will be a live debate held in London but we're going to have people speaking in different countries about that. And we're also doing a big debate called \"What does it mean to be a good girl or an ideal woman?\". December the 1<sup>st</sup> we have three topics - leadership, relationships and image - and we're going to do three live debates on that day. And we've sent out packs to over 100 women's groups around the world, so that on the day they all get involved.</span>\n<strong><span>Li<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So at the core of the project 100 Women there will be live debates. By the way, the word 'core' means 'the central part of it'.</span>\n<strong>Catherine<br/></strong>\nIndeed. And as you know Li, in some countries, women face some fairly basic problems… Here's\n<strong>Tammi Walker</strong>\nagain. And this time, what word means, well, you know, what you do when you go to the toilet?\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">INSERT</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Tammi Walker, BBC social media producer for 100 Women<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">We are tying in with World Toilet Day, with the right to <strong>pee</strong>. For example in India, women are charged 25 rupees to go to the toilet whereas men obviously can go anywhere for free. You don't have to pay to go! </span>\n<strong><span>Li<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. Women in India have to pay to pee – it means to urinate, to pass water – while men can go anywhere. It is a matter of public health too. </span>\n<strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Most definitely. Now, this is the third BBC 100 Women season. Last time it prompted a big discussion in Iran. Let's hear what Sanam Dolatshahi has to say. She's a producer from BBC Persian. And can you understand what the word <strong>sexism</strong> means?</span>\n<span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Sanam Dolatshahi, producer, BBC Persian<br/></strong></span>\n<span>Many people are familiar with other 'isms' you know – for example, racism. When you say 'racism' people know what it means in Iran. But not necessarily sexism. Many people confused it with sex. So some people were asking us: Air your programmes about sexism after the watershed, after 9 pm, you know, so that the children will not watch. </span>\n<strong>Li<br/></strong>\nSexism means to have a very strict idea of what each sex can or can't do and it is a form of prejudice. Sometimes people are prejudiced and they don't even know it.\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Catherine<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Absolutely. But this prejudice, whether known or unknown, can bring a lot of suffering. Well, there's a lot more we could say about women in our society but we are running out of time. So let's get back to our quiz question Li…</span>\n<strong><span>Li<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yeah. You asked me about women in powerful positions…<br/><br/></span>\n<strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That's right. I asked you: How many heads of state or government do we have around the world now, in 2015? Is it:</span>\n<span>a)</span>\n<span>9<br/></span>\n<span>b)</span>\n<span>19 or<br/></span>\n<span>c)</span>\n<span>29</span>\n<strong><span>Li<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And I said c) 29.<br/><br/></span>\n<strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Unfortunately Li, it's wrong! The correct answer is b) 19. And according to a 2015 United Nations report, in 1995 there were only 12 female heads of state or government but now there are 19. And before you go let me remind you of some of the key words we've used today. They were:</span>\n<span>covered<br/></span>\n<span>childless<br/></span>\n<span>role<br/></span>\n<span>discrimination <br/></span>\n<span>at the core<br/></span>\n<span>pee<br/></span>\n<span>sexism<br/><br/></span>\n<strong><span>Li<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that just about brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English. We would like to invite you to follow the BBC 100 Women season in English or your own language. Men are invited too. </span>\n<strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And you can find the programmes using the hashtag 100women or go to </span>\n<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/100women\"><span>www.bbc.com/100women</span></a>\n<span>.

What is the Mexican version of One Direction?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nUm… No idea.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nJuan Direction. Get it?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nVery good…\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\n<em>Juan</em>\nDirection... You know?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, yes, I get it.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nNever mind. Can you guess what the subject of today's show is instead?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nIs it bad jokes?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nCome on! That was a good little gag! Yes. The subject of today's show is… what makes us laugh. And in this context, to get something, for example a gag – or joke, means to understand it. We all like to laugh – well not you apparently – but most of us do! It's good for our health, it reduces stress and releases feel-good hormones in the body.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nOK, thank you, Neil. But how about answering today's quiz question? Which Greek word means the study of laughter and its effects on the body? Is it…\n<br/>\na) risology?\n<br/>\nb) gelotology?\n<br/>\nor c) comology?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nThat's difficult and I'm going to say c) comology because it's got the word 'comedy' in it, you see?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nOh, very good. OK. Well, we'll find out later if you're right. Now, did you know, we rarely laugh when we're on our own? Laughter is a social thing that we generally like to share with other people.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nReally? I laugh when I'm watching cartoons on my own – don't you, Alice?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nNo, Neil, I don't. Anyway, some researchers believe that the purpose of laughter is related to the way we bond with each other. And the more we laugh, the more we bond as a group.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nInteresting idea. It could explain why stand-up comedy – where a comedian performs in front of and talks directly to their audience – is very popular entertainment. But what does it take to keep your audience laughing? Let’s listen to Steve Byrne, a successful US comedian talking about this.\n<strong>INSERT</strong>\n<br/>\n<strong>Steve Byrne, comedian</strong>\n<br/>\nThe one single thing an aspiring comedian should do is to write, write, write and talk about the things that make them laugh. Selfishness – time to be selfish – time to be a little narcissistic. What is it that makes you laugh? Because that will get you closer to finding your voice. Because ultimately that's why people come see you.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nSo comedians need to be selfish and narcissistic – that sounds pretty negative!\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, it does. Narcissistic means being too interested in yourself – for example your appearance or other personal qualities. And aspiring means wanting to be successful in your chosen career.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd what does Steve mean when he says comedians need to find their voice?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, he means they need to talk about what they think in a way that's unique – meaning unusual or special – to them.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nOK. Let's listen to Steve again talking about turning 40 and what he finds funny about that.\n<strong>INSERT</strong>\n<br/>\n<strong>Steve Byrne, comedian</strong>\n<br/>\nWhen you turn 40 you will hear this in your life and hopefully you'll hear this the rest of your life. 'You look good for 40. You look good for 52. You look great for 63.' You never hear that when you're young. You never hear: 'You look good for 19.'\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou think there's going to be some magic potion – some magic shortcut to it all. It's writing and getting up on stage. It takes a lot of perseverance and it's such a competitive occupation. You know, you've just got to outwork everybody.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, we heard Steve making his audience laugh there. And by the way, Alice, you look fantastic for 40.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nThat's not funny, Neil. I'm only 39 and you know it. Anyway, moving on, Steve says there's no magic potion or shortcut to success. You have to work hard – it doesn't happen by itself. And perseverance means to keep on trying to achieve something even when it's difficult.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nHe says you have to outwork everybody – which means to work harder than everybody else. Steve certainly doesn't make comedy sound much fun, does he?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nNo. In fact some people say there's a connection between depression and comedy – that comedians can be introverted and depressive.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nIs that right? Introverts are generally quiet people who are more interested in their own thoughts and feelings than in spending time with other people.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, you'd think that most comedians would be extroverts – people who are lively and enjoy the company of others. OK I think it's time for the answer to our quiz question, Neil. I asked: Which Greek word means the study of laughter and its effects on the body? Is it…\n<br/>\n<br/>\na) risology?\n<br/>\nb) gelotology?\n<br/>\nor c) comology?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nYes. I said c) comology, which I think I'm beginning to regret now.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, well, indeed. Sorry, I'm afraid that's the wrong answer. It's actually b) gelotology – which comes from the Greek word, gelos, meaning laughter.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nOK. You can stop sniggering now, Alice and just tell us today's words once again?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nAlright then. Here they are:\n<br/>\nget something (e.g. a joke)\n<br/>\ngag\n<br/>\nstand-up comedy\n<br/>\nnarcissistic\n<br/>\naspiring\n<br/>\nunique\n<br/>\nperseverance\n<br/>\noutwork\n<br/>\nintroverts\n<br/>\nextroverts\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, that just about brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nSee you next time.\n<strong>Both</strong>\n<br/>\nBye."

I'm Alice…</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>… and I'm Neil. Hello.</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hello, Neil. Have you been shopping?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I went a bit mad with my credit card actually. </span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Gosh, I can see that! But look at all those plastic bags. Why don't you use your own bags? </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You know what, I'm going to. Because they're now charging 5p per bag!</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Don't you follow the news, Neil? It's a recent government <strong>initiative</strong> – which means a new plan for dealing with something – in this case, to cut the number of thin plastic bags being given away in shops. And the environmental impact of plastic is the subject of today's show.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Is England the first country to charge for these bags, Alice?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>No – other countries in the UK started charging a few years ago. And countries around the world including Bangladesh, South Africa, China, and Italy have actually banned them altogether.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Interesting. But I don't throw my bags away, Alice. I put them under the kitchen sink. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Are you a <strong>hoarder</strong>, Neil? That means someone who collects large amounts of stuff and can't throw things away.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Maybe I am… But seriously, with the 5p charge I'm definitely going to recycle my plastic bags. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Good. Now let me ask you today's quiz question, Neil: How many tonnes of plastic rubbish from the UK is being sent to China each year for recycling? Is it:<br/></span>\n<span>a) 20,000?<br/></span>\n<span>b) 200,000?<br/></span>\n<span>or c) 2,000,000?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well I think it's … a) 20,000. </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>We'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. But first, why are plastic bags bad for the environment?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Because they're too thin? And when they break all your shopping falls out? That must be it.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>No. They take hundreds of years to <strong>decompose</strong> – or break down by natural chemical processes. And also people don't dispose of them properly. They litter our streets. They <strong>clog </strong>– or block – drains and sewers. They spoil the countryside and damage wildlife.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well that's quite a list. So what's the solution then, Alice?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well to either recycle or stop using plastic bags. But let's hear about the pharmaceutical company with another idea. This is BBC reporter John Maguire.</span>\n<span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>John Maguire, BBC reporter<br/></strong></span>\n<span>At this company laboratory in North London they're testing how bags made with a special additive break down when exposed to sunlight, oxygen and heat… The technology was discovered by a British scientist in the 1970s and is now sold to around half the world's countries. In some, biodegradable bags are backed by law. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And <strong>biodegradable</strong> means able to break down naturally in a way that isn't harmful to the environment.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So adding small amounts of a chemical to the plastic – a special <strong>additive</strong> – allows the plastic to break down in the open air. But if the technology was discovered back in the 1970s, why aren't these biodegradable bags being used in <em>every</em> country by now?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I have no idea, Alice. Maybe they aren't as strong as non-biodegradable bags. I like a good strong bag, myself, you see.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Alright. Well, just go and buy yourself some canvas bags, Neil! In fact, I'll get you some for your birthday. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Thank you.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>You're very welcome. Now, moving on. Out of around 300 million tons of plastic produced every year, some goes in <strong>landfill</strong> – a place where our rubbish is buried under the earth – but about 10% of plastic ends up in the sea. Let's listen to Biologist Dr Pennie Lindeque from Plymouth Marine Laboratory talking about this.</span>\n<span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Biologist Dr Pennie Lindeque from Plymouth Marine Laboratory<br/></strong></span>\n<span>We're already finding that there's a lot of microplastics in the sea and that some of these microplastics are actually being ingested by the zooplankton that live there. We're also concerned this could end up being passed up through the food chain to food which is destined for human consumption so it could end up on your or my plate.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What are <strong>microplastics</strong>, Alice?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>They're small plastic fragments less than 5mm in size. You find them in cosmetic products such as facial scrubs, shower gel, and toothpaste. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>And I'm guessing that <strong>ingested</strong> means 'eaten'? </span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, the <strong>zooplankton</strong> – tiny little animals in the sea – mistake the microplastics for food and eat them. And because the zooplankton and humans are in the same food chain – they're at the bottom and we're at the top – but we're still connected – we may end up eating them and the microplastics inside them!</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That doesn't sound very tasty! Now a <strong>food chain</strong>, by the way, refers to a series of living things where each creature feeds on the one below it in the chain.</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Indeed. OK. Remember my question from earlier? I asked: How many tonnes of plastic rubbish from the UK is being sent to China each year for recycling? Is it…<br/></span>\n<span>a) 20,000?<br/></span>\n<span>b) 200,000?<br/></span>\n<span>or c) 2,000,000?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said a) 20,000.</span>\n<span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes but you're wrong, I'm afraid. The answer is b) 200,000 tonnes. And that statistic comes from the University of Cambridge in the UK. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's a load of rubbish! Get it – load of rubbish?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Very good.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Can we hear today's words again please?</span>\n<strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>\n<span>We certainly can. Here they are:<br/></span>\n<span>initiative<br/></span>\n<span>hoarder<br/></span>\n<span>decompose<br/></span>\n<span>clog<br/></span>\n<span>biodegradable<br/></span>\n<span>additive<br/></span>\n<span>landfill<br/></span>\n<span>microplastics<br/></span>\n<span>ingested<br/></span>\n<span>zooplankton<br/></span>\n<span>food chain</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that brings us to the end of this 6 Minute English.

I'm Finn…</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>… and I'm Neil. Hello. Today we are talking about Shakespeare. </span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Oh yes… to be or not to be, that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler…  </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah. OK, thank you. Thank you very much, Finn. But what does that famous Shakespeare line actually mean, Finn?  </span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yeah, well… it's quite hard to explain actually. The English in Shakespeare's work is quite difficult. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, a Shakespeare festival in Oregon in the United States wants to change all of that. They want to pay writers – they want to <strong>commission</strong> - what they call '<strong>translations</strong>' of Shakespeare's plays. Now we usually use the word translation of course to talk about changing words and sentences from one language to another. But these writers have been commissioned to translate Shakespearean English into <strong>plain</strong> English. </span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So Shakespeare in easy, plain English… You know, I'm not sure I really like that idea.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, you're not the only one, Finn. We will talk about that in a moment, but first, as usual, we have our quiz question and it's about Shakespeare and translation. What was the first language that Shakespeare's plays were translated into? Was it:<br/></span>\na)    French\n<br/>\nb)    German or\n<br/>\n<span>c)</span>\nPortuguese\n<br/>\n<span>What do you think?</span>\n<strong><span>Finn</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>You know, I really have no idea on this one. I'm going to say b) German. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>We'll see if you're right at the end of the programme. But now we're going to hear from two Shakespeare experts speaking to the BBC. First, Andrew Dickinson. He is the author of 'Worlds Elsewhere: Journeys Around Shakespeare's <strong>Globe</strong>'. </span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>In his travels around the world - around the globe – did he find many translations of Shakespeare?<br/><br/></span>\n<strong><span>INSERT<br/>Andrew Dickinson, the author of 'Worlds Elsewhere: Journeys Around Shakespeare's Globe'</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>Someone’s translated Hamlet into Klingon. You know, he exists in all of these different places and all of these different forms and I suppose that what really <strong>struck</strong> me while working on my book and travelling around the world talking to people about Shakespeare is that he is so <strong>multifarious</strong> - he exists in all of these places. It feels sometimes that we in the English-speaking world are only just catching up with this. </span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Shakespeare expert Andrew Dickinson, who has travelled the world for his new book and knows about many translations, even one from out of this world! </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, he says someone has even translated Hamlet into Klingon. Now that's the language spoken by aliens in Star Trek, which is of course a science fiction TV series, it's not a real language.</span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Let's get back to the real world, Neil. Andrew Dickinson says that what really impressed him – what really <em>struck</em> him - while working on his new book and travelling around the world talking about Shakespeare is that Shakespeare is so <em>multifarious</em>. Multifarious - that's quite a difficult word.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, it is. Well in plain English it means that there are many different types. There are many different translations, many different kinds of Shakespeare. </span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>He's multifarious.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Finn! We're using plain English in this programme, like the people in Oregon who want to translate Shakespeare into plain English. That will make his plays easier to understand. </span>\n<strong><span>Finn <br/></span></strong>\n<span>And that's a good thing. But there has also been strong criticism about this from academics who study Shakespeare as well as from people on social media – on Facebook and Twitter. They think it's a bad idea.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Our next Shakespeare expert is Greg Doran. He is the Artistic Director of the Royal Shakespeare Company. He's done productions outside Britain. Where did he do a production of the Shakespeare play, Merchant of Venice? Here he is talking about the difficulty of translation.</span>\n<strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong>\n<strong><span>Greg Doran, Artistic Director of the Royal Shakespeare Company<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I think the difficulty with a translation is that it simply translates <strong>the sense</strong> and there's a lot more going on in the language of Shakespeare's plays. I remember once doing a production of Merchant of Venice in Japan and I was asked – we were having a new translation done - and I was asked if I wanted the translation for meaning, for <strong>pace</strong> or for poetry and that's the difficulty. You've got to find all three somehow together. </span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Greg Doran, Artistic Director of the Royal Shakespeare Company. He was doing a Shakespeare production in Japan. He says that the difficulty with translation is that it only translates the sense – it is only the general meaning. But he says that there's more than that.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>They were having a translation done and he was asked if he wanted the translation for meaning or for pace – that’s about the speed of the lines in the play - or was the poetry of the words important? </span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And his answer was that you've got to find all three somehow together. It is not just one thing. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>He says that there is a lot going on – there is a lot happening - in the language of Shakespeare's plays. </span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And so a simple translation of the words into plain English isn't really… Shakespeare. And I think it's time to answer our quiz question.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, if you remember, it's about translations of Shakespeare. </span>\n<span>What was the first language that Shakespeare's plays were translated into? Was it:<br/></span>\n<span>a)</span>\n<span>French<br/></span>\nb)    German\n<br/>\nc)    Portuguese\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I said b) German, which I'll admit was a guess.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And that is the right answer.</span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Fantastic!</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Apparently Shakespeare's plays were translated into German as early as the first decade of the 17<sup>th</sup> Century. And that’s all for now. Please do join us again for 6 Minute English. </span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>To be or not be... </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, OK. Thanks, Finn.</span>\n<strong><span>Both<br/></span></strong>\nBye."

But yes, you need to <strong>balance</strong> on this device which means you need to stand on it and not fall over.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well this device has other names as well. It's called a rideable because you ride on it like you ride on a bicycle – or you can call it a self-balancing <strong>scooter</strong> - or others call it a hoverboard.  </span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That's perhaps because it looks like a <strong>skateboard </strong>perhaps… but it's different, isn't it? </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes it is, it is a bit different. And we'll be finding out more about hoverboards in a moment, but first it's time for our quiz question. I'm going to make a statement and I want you to tell me, Finn, if it is true or false. OK?</span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK.<br/><br/></span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Here in the UK, it's <strong>illegal</strong> to ride a hoverboard on the <strong>pavement</strong>. Is that true or false, Finn? What do you think? </span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, I've actually seen someone riding a hoverboard on the pavement so I'll say it's false. I think it's legal to ride one on the pavement. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>OK, then. We'll see if you're right at the end of the programme. </span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK. So, Neil have you ever tried riding on a hoverboard? </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, I haven't, but I would like to give it a go. It looks like a skateboard, but it is different – it moves differently – and it goes in a different direction – it goes… sideways. </span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes. And, you know, the other big difference is that it is motorised. And when you change your balance the wheels turn. So when you lean forwards – you move forwards – and when you lean back you slow down and stop… and if you lean even further back, then you actually move backwards. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. So it's hard to keep your balance. Like a skateboard, you need to practise to get good at this. </span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And I'm no good at skateboards. And I think, you know, if you don't practise you'll fall off the hoverboard lots of times. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>BBC reporter Emma Ailes has tried a hoverboard. Who else has tried one of these rideables? Listen to her report.  </span>\n<span><strong>INSERT<br/>Emma Ailes, BBC Reporter<br/></strong>So you may have seen in recent weeks <strong>celebrities</strong> like Justin Bieber and Lily Allen riding one of these. It's a self-balancing transportation device or some people call them rideables. I've never had a go but I am going to <strong>integrate</strong> one into my life in the next couple of days and see how I <strong>get on</strong>.  </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And that was the BBC reporter Emma Ailes. She said that she's going to <strong>integrate</strong> riding a h</span>\n<span>overboard into her everyday life and so perhaps she'll travel to the BBC on a hoverboard. Now to integrate means to combine things to make them more efficient.</span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Or maybe she'll go shopping on a hoverboard. Now she talked about celebrities – famous people - who are using hoverboards. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah. She mentioned two celebrities – singers Lily Allen – who's British. And Justin Bieber - he's from Canada. So people are using hoverboards all over the world. </span>\n<strong><span>Finn</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>Neil, you were telling me about a guy you saw last weekend.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>Yes, I was at a shopping centre and there were all these kids – teenagers - watching this guy using a hoverboard.  Of course they all wanted to try it.  You could hear them shouting: \"Can I have a go? Can I have a go? Can I <strong>have a go</strong>?\" Now, to have a go means to try something.</span>\n<strong><span>Finn</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>Yes. Now what was our reporter's experience of using a hoverboard? How did she get on? Did she learn how to use it? Did she enjoy using it? </span>\n<strong><span>INSERT</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span><strong>Emma Ailes</strong><br/>So overall this is really good fun and I definitely recommend giving it a go. But there are some <strong>downsides</strong>. It's really heavy, it's illegal to use it on the pavement and it's quite embarrassing being stared at. So are two wheels better than two legs? For me, probably not. </span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So that was the BBC reporter Emma once again. And she tried to use the two wheels of the hoverboard to move around but she said she prefers moving with her two legs. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But she did say this about using a hoverboard - it's good fun and she definitely recommends that people try it – they should give it a go!</span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>But she said there are also some <strong>downsides</strong> – some bad things. First, it's heavy. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, it's not very easy carrying a heavy hoverboard. </span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Also when she uses it everyone looks at her and they don't stop looking – they stare at her and she says that's embarrassing.  </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And there is one more downside about using a self-balancing scooter. And this is also the answer to our quiz question… I asked if it's true or false that it's illegal to ride a hoverboard on the pavement in the UK. </span>\n<strong><span>Finn</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>And I said that it's false.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>And you are… wrong. It's illegal. There is a law here about that.</span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, I realised I guessed the wrong answer when I heard that clip from Emma's report there. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. Their use is illegal under Section 72 of the Highway Act 1835 for use on the public pavements and roads in the UK. </span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Oh, very impressive, Neil. Now, you can use a hoverboard, I've heard, on <strong>private property</strong> if you have permission from the owner but NOT on public pavements and roads. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK. Well, next time you see your friend Justin Bieber, Finn, tell him that. </span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I will. Now, that's all for today. Please do join us again soon.<br/><br/></span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Please do. And let's hear the words before we go.<br/><br/></span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK. We heard:</span>\n<span>device</span>\n<span>balance</span>\n<span>pavement</span>\n<span>scooter</span>\n<span>skateboard</span>\n<span>celebrities</span>\n<span>to get on</span>\n<span>to have a go</span>\n<span>illegal</span>\n<span>private property</span>\n<span>That is it now.

The answer, unfortunately for you, might well be yes. These days more and more jobs are done more efficiently by a machine. Listen to Neil and Finn's conversation and learn new vocabulary.\nWhat makes a job more likely to be done by robots?

I'm Neil…</span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>… and I'm Finn. Hello.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello there, Finn. Now, what do you know about robots?</span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Robots? Well, (Finn does an impression of a robot voice) they talk in a funny way… like that!</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. You sound quite convincing there actually, Finn. <br/><br/><strong>Finn</strong><br/>Do you like it?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, I do. Is there anything else you know about robots?<br/><br/></span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well, there are… there are a couple of good ones in the Star Wars, aren't there?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh, yes. R2-D2 and C-3PO. C-3PO talks in quite a human voice.</span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>He does. But of course that's science fiction not real life. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No. But things have moved on in real life. The use of machines to do work that people do or used to do is called <strong>automation</strong> and that's the subject of today's show.</span>\n<span><strong>Finn  <br/></strong>But before we talk more about this, l'd like you, Neil, to answer today's quiz question. What makes a job more likely to be done by robots? Is it if a job involves…</span>\n<span>a) manipulating small objects?</span>\n<span>b)<strong> </strong>working in open spaces?</span>\n<span>Or c)<strong> </strong>social and emotional skills?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hmm… OK. Well, I'm going to guess. Manipulating small objects, I think. </span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Interesting. OK, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. Now, two UK academics have calculated how <strong>susceptible</strong> <strong>to</strong> – that means likely to be affected by – how susceptible to automation each job is based on some key skills. And these include negotiation, persuasion, caring for others, originality, and <strong>manual dexterity</strong> – now that means being good with your hands.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil</span><br/></strong>\n<span>So do you think intelligent machines could replace us?</span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, maybe you, Neil. Not me, no. I have all the key skills you know – I'm original… persuasive… of course very caring and very good with my hands as well, I think. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well I'm very glad that you're safe, Finn! <br/><br/><strong>Finn</strong><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/><strong>Neil</strong><br/>However, a study from Oxford University has suggested that 35% of existing UK jobs are being automated in the next 20 years. Let’s listen to Michael Osborne from Oxford University talking about this.</span>\n<strong><span>INSERT<br/>Michael Osborne, University of Oxford<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Computers are increasingly able to learn in a way that in short has been a reserve of human beings. So in their ability to learn, computers are able to perform a much wider range of tasks than they've been able to do in the past. So as a result it's not just manual labour that's coming under threat of automation. It's increasingly cognitive labour – the labour of the mind.</span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Michael Osborne. And <strong>cognitive labour</strong> means using your <strong>noggin</strong> – that's using or head!So computers and machines are using their noggins and getting smarter. And office workers who do repetitive jobs such as drawing up spreadsheets could be replaced with software. But surely jobs like being a doctor or a lawyer are safe, Neil?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>Well, some white-collar jobs may be less safe than you think. At one city law firm junior staff have to read through contracts, assessing them for risks. But now an artificial intelligence programme can do that faster and better.</span>\n<strong><span>Finn</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>So <strong>white collar</strong> refers to a job that you do at an office rather than a factory. And <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> refers to a computer's ability to copy intelligent human behaviour. Now let’s listen to Matthew Whalley from a city law firm to find out what he thinks.</span>\n<strong><span>INSERT</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<strong><span>Matthew Whalley, Berwin Leigton Paisner<br/></span></strong>\n<span>What you're seeing the robot do now, the robot can do in three seconds what would take a group of lawyers days to do. And the advantage is that it can do huge volumes, incredibly reliably in unbelievable times. There is a huge amount of this work to do and lawyers have far better higher-value legal analysis to worry about.  </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well he thinks that there is work for the lawyers and the computers. In fact it sounds like a good division of labour – the computers do the boring stuff and the lawyers do the more interesting work!</span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes. Well, let's keep our fingers crossed that we've got good prospects. You know, I don't want our listeners to (robot voice) start listening to robot presenters any time soon!</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Indeed, we need! We talk about <strong>keeping our fingers crossed </strong>when we hope that things are going to turn out in the way we want them to in the future.</span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That's right. So shall we hear the answer to today's quiz question? Neil, I asked you: What makes a job more likely to be done by robots? Is it if a job involves… a) manipulating small objects? b)<strong> </strong>working in open spaces? Or c)<strong> </strong>social and emotional skills?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I said a) manipulating small objects ... and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I've got the right answer.</span>\n<span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK. You’re keeping them crossed? </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, I am.</span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>You've got the answer right! Well done!</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Brilliant! I'm glad my cognitive skills are still functioning. Now, how about hearing those words again?</span>\n<strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK, the words we heard today were:</span>\n<span>automation</span>\n<span>susceptible to</span>\n<span>manual dexterity</span>\n<span>cognitive labour</span>\n<span>noggin</span>\n<span>white collar</span>\n<span>artificial intelligence (AI)</span>\n<span>and … keeping your fingers crossed</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that brings us to the end of this 6 Minute English. We hope you enjoyed the programme. Please join us again soon.</span>\n<span><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye.</span>"

I'm Neil…\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\n… and I'm Alice. Sorry, wait a minute Neil. I'm just finishing this book.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nOK.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nLast page… nearly there… ohh - fantastic book!\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell I'm glad you enjoyed that. I'm glad you finished your book there Alice! We're talking about books in today's programme. What was it you were reading there?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nNo, never mind Neil. It's not your kind of book. You wouldn't like it.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nHow do you know?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, I just think you might read something a little more intellectual.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nOh I see… Well we are talking about the kinds of books people read and what they say about them today.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nYes. Perhaps you read the works of a famous writer – the classics – Charles Dickens, Shakespeare.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nPeople will think you are an intellectual. You can show off by reading these books – the classics.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nOr perhaps you read popular novels or romantic fiction – a light easy read.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWhen you go on holiday – maybe to the beach – what kind of books do you read? And what do you read when you're going to work?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nWe're going to hear part of a BBC interview with David Adshead from the Commuter Book Club. A commuter travels to work by bus, train or here in London, The Tube, a train that goes all over the city, mostly underground.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd Alice as usual, we have a quiz question. Are you ready?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, absolutely.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nOK. It's about classic book sales. So these days are people buying…\na) more classic books?\nb) the same number of classic books?\nc) fewer classic books than they used to?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nOh that's an interesting one. Tricky to guess but I'm going to say c) fewer classic books.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nOK, well, let’s find out the answer at the end of the programme. But now, here is David Adshead from the Commuter Club. What kind of book does he say people usually take with them to the beach?\n<strong>INSERT</strong>\n<br/>\n<strong>David Adshead, Commuter Book Club</strong>\n<br/>\nPeople often think that, you know, traditionally you take a light easy read for the beach and on the train, um, you maybe read something very different.\n<strong>Interviewer<br/></strong>\n… if only to show off.\n<strong>David Adshead<br/></strong>\nExactly, to appear to others to be more intellectual. But actually, what we find in this is that it really comes down to the individual – what they like to read and actually we've seen this summer a lot of the book sales - summer reads is generally lighter books, easier to get on with, to take away on holiday - but the big retailers have seen a shift actually - people moving sort of slightly higher brow, taking away more classic books. Sales in that way have increased.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nDavid Adshead from the Commuter Book Club there. He says that people usually – traditionally - take a light, easy read to the beach or on the train.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nYes. He says these books are easier to get on with. David says that it really comes down to the individual - each person is different. But he says that there has been a shift – a change – in what people read.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, he says that the shops that sell books – that's the retailers – say the books people are buying are more highbrow – the classics, as we were talking about.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely. Highbrow books are read by intellectuals or perhaps the people who read these books are just showing off.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, maybe they are. Well I wonder if these people have read any books by Fiona Harper. She writes romantic novels – that's stories about love.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nLight reading – not highbrow. She was also at this interview about the Commuter Book Club.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nNow, do commuters read her romantic novels on the Tube?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nWell here is novelist Fiona Harper talking about how she writes her romantic novels. She wants people to not stop reading her stories once they start – she wants them to be hooked.\n<strong>INSERT</strong>\n<br/>\n<strong>Author Fiona Harper</strong>\n<br/>\nI think what it comes down to most of the time is you just want to write a really good story because if you write a good story then hopefully people are hooked, they'll keep turning the pages and..\n<strong>Interviewer</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd do you wonder whether they are reading them on holiday? I mean presumably, they're more likely to read your stuff on holiday than when they’re sitting on the Tube being looked at by lots of other people. I don't know.\n<br/>\n<strong><br/>Author Fiona Harper<br/></strong>\nPossibly, although with the advent of e-readers, you can read anything you like and no one knows – or on your phone – no one knows what you're reading.\n<br/>\n<strong><br/>Interviewer</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd that's an important point.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nThat's the author Fiona Harper talking about romantic novels. So do commuters read her books on the Tube?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nWell perhaps you don't want others to see you reading that stuff. It can be a bit embarrassing. It shouldn't be, but Fiona says you can also use an e-reader.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nAn e-reader – that's an electronic book. Instead of pages, you read off a screen.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nWell if you use an e-reader or tablet, no one knows what you're reading.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nSo perhaps they are reading a romantic novel – no one knows. OK. Let's take a moment to look at some of today's words.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nHere they are:\nintellectual\nshow off\nthe classics\nromantic fiction\nlight read\nheavy read\nretailers\nhighbrow\nshift\nhooked\nadvent\ne-reader\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd before we go, the answer to today's quiz question. I asked about classic books. Are people these days buying…\na) more classic books?\nb) the same number of classic books?\nc) fewer classic books than they used to?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nYes. And I said c) fewer classic books.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell I'm afraid to say Alice that you're wrong.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nOh no.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nI know. They're reading more classic books!\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nOh excellent!\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nSales of these books are apparently increasing.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nWell that's good to hear.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Please do join us again soon.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd keep reading books… in English. Highbrow classics or a light read – it doesn't matter.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nIt doesn't matter at all.\n<strong>Both</strong>\n<br/>\nBye."

I'm Rob…\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\n… and I'm Neil. Hello.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nWell Neil I've got a question for you straight away. Were you a summer baby? Were you born in the summer?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nUm…Yes, I was actually. Late summer.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nOK. And did you go to university?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nYes…? Strange questions here, Rob.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nNot really. My questions do make sense because we're talking about the impact when you were born has on how well you perform at school.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nOK. Are you calling me stupid here, Rob?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nNothing like that. Well maybe… let's wait and see what the experts have to say. But before that, I've got another question for you.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nOK then – let's see if I'm clever enough to answer it!\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nOK. Well, based on birth records between 1973 and 1999, what is the most common birthday for a person in the United States? Is it:\na) 1st January\nb) 16th September\nc) 30th March\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nI'm gonna guess 30th March.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nOK. Well, we'll hear the answer at the end of the programme. Another question now. According to research, are summer born babies\n<strong>more likely</strong>\nor\n<strong>less likely</strong>\nto go to university?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, we are going to hear from an expert. Lorraine Dearden, who is Professor of Economics and Social Statistics at University College London (UCL). She was interviewed by the BBC about summer-born babies. She talks about the research, how well do they do in tests. How do they\n<strong>perform</strong>\n?\n<strong>INSERT</strong>\n<br/>\n<strong>Professor Lorraine Dearden, University College London</strong>\n<br/>\nAll the research has shown that summer born kids perform much worse in tests right through up until the age of eighteen and even … they're less likely to attend\n<strong>higher education</strong>\n.\n<br/>\n<strong>BBC interviewer</strong>\n<br/>\nI mean, these are\n<strong>startling</strong>\nstatistics 20% are less likely to go to university.\n<br/>\n<strong>Professor Lorraine Dearden, University College London</strong>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nThat was Professor Lorraine Deardon with some really really surprising statistics – startling statistics, in fact.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, she says summer born kids perform much worse in tests.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, these summer born kids perform worse at school right through until the age of eighteen when they might be thinking about going to university.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, university. That's higher education.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nSo the professor said, according to research, summer babies are less likely to go to university - 20% in fact.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nReally? Well, don’t forget Rob, I told you I'm a summer baby. Well, I went to university.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, of course. These are just\n<strong>statistics</strong>\n– just figures. But if you are a parent of a child starting school these statistics are worrying.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell they shouldn't worry. There are lots of people who were born in the summer that have done very well at university, thank you. And some of them are now professors.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nOK. Or BBC presenters… like you Neil.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, like me. But here is the problem. Let's say you have a child. He's a boy, born in August. He's now 4 years old so he can start school this September. But in his class there are students whose birthday is coming very soon so they’re going to be 5 – that's almost a year older than your child.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nSo parents want their kids to do well at school – they are concerned - and now the government is trying to help – they're trying to\n<strong>address</strong>\nthose\n<strong>concerns</strong>\n. England's schools minister Nick Gibbs says that the government wants to change the\n<strong>admissions</strong>\nrules for schools.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nThe rule now in much of England is that children must start school in September after their fourth birthday.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nThe schools minister says these rules should be changed. \"Parents know their children best,\" said Mr Gibb.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nParents don't want to send their children to school before they are ready.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nSo here is the proposal – or suggested new rules. If a child is born in the summer, parents could\n<strong>delay</strong>\nthe child's start of school by up to a year.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nSo the child will start school at 5 years old. Great, but does our expert Professor Lorraine Deardon think that's a good idea. Is this the way to address the problem of the age difference?\n<strong>INSERT</strong>\n<br/>\n<strong>Professor Lorraine Deardon, University College London</strong>\n<br/>\nAh no, it's not. I mean, basically, the reason why these children do worse in tests right throughout their life is simply that they are up to a year younger than their September born colleagues and this does nothing to address this.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nProfessor Lorraine Deardon. She says that the new\n<strong>policy</strong>\ndoes nothing to address the problem of the age difference.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nThere are still going to be 4 year olds in the class. Perhaps there will be more 5 year olds now because parents can delay their child's start at school.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, the new policy addresses the concerns of parents that their children are not ready for school at 4 years old….\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\n… but there will always be this age difference in a classroom and many of the younger children will do worse in tests. Professor Deardon says that the proposal to change the schools admission policy does nothing to address this.\nOK, time now for the answer to the question I set you at the beginning of the programme. I asked: based on birth records between 1973 and 1999, what is the most common birthday for a person in the United States? Is it:\na) 1st January\nb) 16th September\nc) 30th March\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd I guessed the 30th March.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nBut you are wrong I'm afraid. The answer is actually the 16th September. Happy birthday to whoever was born then anyway.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nYeah. OK, Rob. Can you tell us the words we learned today again please?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nOf course. We heard:\nmore likely / less likely\nperform\nhigher education\nstartling\nstatistics\nadmissions\ndelay\npolicy\nconcerns\naddress the problem\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, that's the end of 6 Minute English. Please do join us again soon.\n<strong>Both</strong>\n<br/>\nBye."

I'm Rob…\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\n… and I'm Alice. Hello.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nHi there, Alice! Now, have you read any books by Jules Verne?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, I have. Journey to the Centre of the Earth was my favourite book as a child! A German Professor and his two companions climb down a volcano in search of the Earth’s centre – or core. They visit strange lands inhabited by dinosaurs and giant prehistoric humans, and sail across an underground ocean.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nHmm. Very exciting but it doesn’t sound very realistic. How do they get out again?\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, they shoot to the surface from the mouth of Mount Etna during a volcanic eruption.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nWow! That sounds very uncomfortable! Well, on today's show we're going to discuss what scientists really know about the Earth's core.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nYes. The Earth has a dense inner core surrounded by a fluid outer core. Dense, by the way, means heavy in relation to its size. But, Rob, I've got a question for you as usual: how big do you think the inner core is? Is it the size of …\na) the Moon?\nb) Jupiter?\nor c) Mars?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nRight! Well, I haven't a clue to be honest so I'm going to take a guess and say c) Mars.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, we'll find out later on in the show if you're right. But before we get there, let's find out a bit more about what the Earth is made of.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, the Earth has layers, a bit like an onion.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nI like your technical language, Rob!\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nBut I'm trying to keep things simple for you, Alice!\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nThanks.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nIt has a thin outer layer or crust where we live. And this includes our continents and the ocean floors. Then beneath that there's another layer called the mantle. And beneath that, is the Earth's core – over 6000km below the surface.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nRight. But what's the Earth made of, Rob?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nIt's a good question. And it depends on which layer you're talking about! The crust and mantle are rock and contain a lot of silicate – which is the same stuff that glass is made of. But the outer and inner parts of the core mainly consist of iron.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd the core is very hot. Am I right?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nYou are indeed. The professor and his companions wouldn't have survived very long down there! The outer core is a swirling mass of molten – or liquid – metal and it’s as hot as the surface of the Sun!\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nWow! That must be so hot! Right. Let's listen now to Simon Redfern talking about the inner core and what's happening in there.\n<strong>Simon Redfern, Professor of Mineral Physics at the University of Cambridge</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd so over time, the planet has started to cool. And as it cools, eventually at the centre of the Earth, the highest pressure point, we pass over the crystallization temperature – the freezing temperature of iron – and iron starts to freeze at the centre of the Earth. And you get a crystal of iron right in the middle that starts to grow.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nI'm a bit worried that the Earth is freezing in the middle!\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nDon't worry, Alice! In this case, because of the incredibly high pressure in the core, the freezing point of iron is actually about 6000 degrees! And the iron has been cooling down and crystallizing for a billion years – and at a rate of just half a millimetre every year.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nAh well, yes, that sounds like slow progress.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nCertainly. Now moving on, we should also talk about the fact that it's the liquid iron outer core that generates magnetic fields – and it's thanks to these magnetic fields that life on Earth is possible. Let's hear more about this.\n<strong>Melvyn Bragg talks to Arwen Deuss, seismologist at Utrecht University</strong>\n<br/>\n<strong>Deuss</strong>\n: Well, the magnetic field is very important because it protects us against cosmic radiation so that's one really...\n<br/>\n<strong>Bragg</strong>\n: How does it do that?\n<br/>\n<strong>Deuss</strong>\n: It just creates a shield, which will just deflect the cosmic rays from the Sun to actually reach us at the surface. So it protects us.\n<br/>\n<strong>Bragg</strong>\n: So it goes up there…\n<br/>\n<strong>Deuss</strong>\n: Yeah, so you would see that the radiation kind of goes right into the Earth and not actually reach us.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nSo there's a magnetic field round the Earth that protects us from the Sun's cosmic rays. I'd like a magnetic field round me. It could be my superpower – like in X Men!\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nCalm down, Magneto. Now the magnetosphere is the area around the Earth in which the Earth's magnetic field is felt. It protects us from the Sun's radiation and the flow of particles, which would otherwise strip away – or remove – the Earth's atmosphere.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nRight, I see. And what does 'radiation' mean?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, radiation means heat or energy or particles in the form of rays – in this case, the Sun's rays.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nOK. And 'deflect'?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nTo deflect means to make something change direction.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nRight, I see. Thank you. Now, Rob, I asked you, do you remember, at the beginning of the show, how big is the Earth's inner core? Is it the size of … a) the Moon? b) Jupiter? or c) Mars?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, and I had a wild guess and I said c) Mars.\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nYes. And I'm afraid that's wrong, Rob. The answer is a) the Moon. Would you like to shape up and tell us which words we learned on the show today?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nOf course. Good idea. We heard:\ncore\ndense\ncrust\nmantle\nsilicate\nmolten\nmagnetosphere\nstrip away\nradiation\ndeflect\n<strong>Alice</strong>\n<br/>\nYes. Thank you, Rob. Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. We hope you enjoyed our core vocabulary! Please join us again soon.\n<strong>Both</strong>\n<br/>\nBye."

I'm Rob…\n<strong>Will</strong>\n<br/>\n… and I'm Will. Hello.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nHi there, Will. I have to say, I like that shirt you're wearing today. I haven't seen that one before.\n<strong>Will</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, I got it at the weekend. But, to be honest, I don't give my clothes much thought. I just throw on the first thing I see. What about you?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, I try to look presentable. I wouldn't want to appear too scruffy. Clothes say an awful lot about us, don't they Will?\n<strong>Will</strong>\n<br/>\nA lot depends on the job you do. In a bank, you're supposed to look pretty smart all the time.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nBut if you work for a design company, say, a suit would look out of place – that means unsuitable. People in the creative industries tend to dress down – that means dress casually – you know jeans and t-shirts.\n<strong>Will</strong>\n<br/>\nYes. Then there's the whole question of what to wear to an interview. I reckon if you put on something smart you can't go far wrong.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nYes. But the meaning of clothes goes far deeper than what you should or shouldn't wear in the workplace, Will. It can really influence what people think of us. Now, rightly or wrongly, they can make snap judgements - or quick decisions - about us.\n<strong>Will</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, you're right. It's a cultural issue. It's about how we see ourselves, too.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nNow, take the sari. It's been around for centuries and is still the main form of dress for millions of women in the Indian subcontinent.\n<strong>Will</strong>\n<br/>\nThat's that very long garment with all those amazing colours and designs, isn't it? It always looks so elegant.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, it does. So Will, can you answer this question: what is the maximum length of a sari? Is it ...\na) 12 metres\nb) 9 metres\nor c) 7 metres\n<strong>Will</strong>\n<br/>\nSurely it can't be 12 metres long! I'm going to say 9 metres.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nOkay. Well, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. But now let's listen to Dr Shahidha Bari talking about the sari. She uses a word that means \"covered\". Can you hear what it is?\n<strong>Dr Shahidha Bari, Queen Mary, University of London</strong>\n<br/>\nSaris encircle the waist, are often pleated and then swept across the upper body with folds and fabric draped over the shoulder or veiling the head. There are more than 80 different ways of wearing a sari and they've been worn in the Indian subcontinent since the first millennium. It's a garment woven into the histories of the countries from which it comes.\n<strong>Will</strong>\n<br/>\nSo draped means \"covered\". Then she used the word garment. That's another word for a piece of clothing. And then she said there are 80 ways of wearing a sari, Rob. Amazing!\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nIt is, isn't it? Some Asian women in the West wear saris just for ceremonial occasions – that means special events like weddings. I suppose, in a sense, it's not that practical for day-to-day use. But it certainly makes a beautiful splash of colour – or a display of colour - when they do wear it.\n<strong>Will</strong>\n<br/>\nWhat she said has got me thinking about English traditional dress. And, to be honest, Rob, I can't recall anything off the top of my head.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nOff the top of your head, Will? That's because you're not wearing a hat.\n<strong>Will</strong>\n<br/>\nDon't be ridiculous, Rob. Off the top of my head. It's an idiom and it means I can't think of anything immediately.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, Will. I do know that actually. It was my attempt at a joke. But you're right: the British dress sense has become a bit samey (it looks the same) – apart from the fashion industry, which is highly regarded throughout the world.\n<strong>Will</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, you wouldn't catch me wearing most of the men's gear you see on the catwalk.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nBut, seriously, Will, clothes are undoubtedly an important business. Let's listen to Dr Shahidha Bari again as she reflects on her mother's use of the sari.\n<strong>Dr Shahidha Bari, Queen Mary, University of London</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd yet the sari makes me feel safe too because I associate it with her body and the world she made for me. And now, as I struggle to keep hold of the sari, the rituals and the memories around it, I fear losing the world it signifies – and her, too.\n<strong>Will</strong>\n<br/>\nShe talked about the way she struggles - that means she finds it difficult - to make the sari important in her life.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd she uses the word signifies, which means giving the meaning of something. The sari obviously has an emotional attachment for her.\n<strong>Will</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd when you think just how much money people spend on clothes, it shows how vital it is.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd let's not forget football shirts, Will. Fans want to be seen in their team's latest shirt design, don't they? I know I do.\n<strong>Will</strong>\n<br/>\nBy the way, what team do you support, Rob?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nAh, well, it's Chelsea, of course. Come on, you Blues. What about you, Will?\n<strong>Will</strong>\n<br/>\nTottenham Hotspur.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nNever mind, someone has to. Now, remember at the beginning of the show I asked you: what is the maximum length of a sari? Is it ...\na) 12 metres\nb) 9 metres\nor c) 7 metres\n<strong>Will</strong>\n<br/>\nYes. And I said 9 metres.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, you know your saris well because that is the right answer. Well done! Now, before we go, it's time to remind ourselves of some of the vocabulary that we've heard today. Will.\n<strong>Will<br/></strong>\nscruffy\nout of place\ndress down\nmake snap judgements\ndraped\ngarment\nceremonial occasions\nsplash of colour\noff the top of my head\nstruggle\nsignifies\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nThank you, Will.

I'm Finn...\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\n...and I'm Neil. Hello.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nNow, Neil, are you doing anything interesting tonight?\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nWell, I was thinking of\n<strong>popping down to</strong>\n- that means visiting - my local pub to catch a band. What about you?\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nWell, my wife and I have got tickets for the Proms tonight.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nThe Proms? You mean that ceremony for high school leavers? I thought you left school decades ago, Finn.\n<strong>Finn</strong>\n<br/>\nAh yes, very funny, Neil. Actually, yeah, it was almost two decades ago. Anyway, the Proms I'm talking about have nothing to do with that. These Proms, or as they're also known, the BBC Proms, are the biggest classical music festival in the world, and they're held in London every summer.\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nAh, yes, of course I know the Proms. And I've even watched the Last Night of the Proms with all those waving flags and the\n<strong>patriotic</strong>\nsinging by the audience. Not really my thing.\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nI know what you mean, but you shouldn't judge the Proms by the concert on the last night, Neil. It's not really typical. Although it is watched by millions of people around the world. And you know, the Proms is also a very old festival... but, how old, Neil? Is it:\na) 57 years?\nb) 84 years?\nc) 120 years old?\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nWell, I don't know, so I'm going to guess and say 84 years.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nOK. Well, we'll find out the answer to that question later.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nOK. So, come on then Finn, sell the Proms to me. What is it that I'm missing?\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nWell, rather a lot, actually. It's not\n<strong>stuck-up </strong>\n- that means a bit superior - in fact, I think there's something for everyone. For example, you might hear something like this...\n<strong>Music</strong>\n<br/>\n[Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony]\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nWow! That was pretty dramatic.\n<strong>It really grips you</strong>\n, doesn't it? What was it?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWell, that was from the first movement of Tchaikovsky's fourth symphony. And at the end you would hear the Prommers showing their appreciation by\n<strong>cheering</strong>\nand clapping.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nRight, so it's almost like Glastonbury, then! So that's the point you're making, is it - the Proms make classical music accessible to everyone. But who are these Prommers?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nAh, well for an answer to that, let's hear from the Director of the BBC Proms, Edward Blakeman.\n<strong>Edward Blakeman - Director of BBC Proms<br/> </strong>\nSo the Prommers, are quite literally the people who stand to listen to the concerts. And there is space for about 800 people, right in the middle of the hall. And this is a long tradition, back, going through the Proms. And it's wonderful because it costs very little, and it means that almost anyone can afford to come to the Proms. So it is a wonderful place for all sorts of people to meet together, and by the way, it's the best place in the hall to hear the music.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nNow, the hall that he's talking about is the Royal Albert Hall in London - and the Prommers are the people who come and stand as they listen to the music. You know, Neil, it's only £5 a ticket.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nRight, so you stand? That sounds like a proper\n<strong>gig</strong>\n. I think I might just give it a go, Finn. So, you've been trying to persuade me that it's quite informal. But, at the same time you do get all those big, fancy classical music names, don't you?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYou do, absolutely. The top soloists - whether that's on the piano, the violin or any other instrument, or singing - they all perform at the Proms. As do very big orchestras.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd I believe the BBC\n<strong>commissions</strong>\nnew works from time to time. I was even told about rock musicians playing there. Can that be right, Finn?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWell, yes Neil. That's actually true. The whole range of music is becoming wider year by year. They also screen concerts to other cities, they hold lunchtime and children's concerts, they even play Indian classical music, like this type of thing...\n<strong>Music</strong>\n<br/>\n[Classical sitar music]\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWhat, playing sitars (and tablas) at the Proms?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYes. But the core of the eight-week festival is devoted to the\n<strong>heavyweight</strong>\ncomposers of the last 400 years - Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and so on. Let me play you another extract of that Tchaikovsky symphony now Neil. Tell me what you think of this.\n<strong>Music</strong>\n<br/>\n[Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony]\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nNow, that was totally different. Much slower and quite sad.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYes, every\n<strong>symphony</strong>\n,\n<strong>concerto</strong>\n, or\n<strong>sonata</strong>\nwill have a slow movement and it will often be deeply emotional.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, you can't beat live music. So, I must get going.\n<strong>Finn</strong>\n<br/>\nOh yeah? Are you off to see that\n<strong>gig</strong>\nat the pub, Neil?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nActually, yes. Or, you know what? I might go and catch a Prom after all.\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nOK. Well, before you hurry off, I have to give you the answer to the quiz. I asked how many years has the BBC Proms been going?\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nAnd I said 84.\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nAnd I'm sorry, Neil. That's the wrong answer.\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nOh no.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nThe correct answer was actually 120 years. Well, that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English. We hope you enjoyed the programme. Join us again soon. Bye.\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nGoodbye."

I'm Rob…\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\n… and I'm Neil. Hello. (cracking knuckles)\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nDon’t do that please, Neil! It makes my flesh creep.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nOh dear, if something makes your flesh creep it means you feel frightened or disgusted by something. I don’t know why I do it. It just feels nice.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nBut you’ll end up with arthritis when you’re older, you know. Arthritis is a disease that causes pain and swelling in joints of the body.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nThat’s an old wives’ tale, Rob! And that means an old idea or belief that has no scientific support.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK, if you say so, Professor. And since you’re in a scientific mood, how about answering today’s quiz question. Which type of joint can you crack? Is it …\na) fibrous?\nb) cartilaginous?\nOr c) synovial?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nOK, this professor isn’t feeling too clever today. I’m going to have to take a guess and say, c) synovial.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK. Well, we’ll find out how smart you really are later on in the programme. Now let’s listen to Greg Kawchuk, Professor of Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Alberta. Rehabilitation means the process of helping somebody get better from an illness or injury.\n<strong>INSERT<br/></strong>\n<strong>Greg Kawchuk, Professor of Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Alberta<br/></strong>\nWe’ve recently been able to use some new technology through MRI imaging to see for the first time what is actually happening inside the joint when someone pops or cracks their knuckles. And because of that we’re hopeful that we’ll be able to start to ask questions about why is it that some people can do this and other people can’t.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWhat does MRI stand for?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nIt means Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Hospitals use this technology to produce an image of the inside of a person’s body.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nSo some people can’t crack their knuckles. Can you, Rob?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nI don’t know, and I’m not about to try. But it isn’t just finger knuckles that crack – you can do it with your neck, back, knees, ankles and toes.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nProfessor Greg Kawchuk says that comparing people who crack their knuckles and people who don’t might provide some insight – or understanding – into whose joints are healthier.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nSounds interesting. But what actually happens when you crack your knuckles, Neil?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, when you stretch or bend your finger to pop the knuckle, you're making the bones of the joint pull apart… like this…(cracking knuckles)\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nPlease don’t do it again!\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, it stretches the space around the joint and surrounding fluid and causes a decrease in pressure. As a result, gas dissolved in the fluid becomes less soluble – or less able to be dissolved – leading to the formation of bubbles. Now when you stretch the joint far enough, these bubbles burst, producing the ‘pop’ sound.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nOuch! Excellent – well, thanks for the biology demonstration there, Neil …\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAny time! Any time, Rob! Now let’s hear from the professor again about the medical value of research into knuckle cracking.\n<strong>INSERT</strong>\n<br/>\n<strong>Greg Kawchuk, Professor of rehabilitation medicine at the University of Alberta<br/></strong>\nWhen our engineering colleagues do this between two flat surfaces say of ceramic or porcelain… When they do this and they pull them apart quickly and there’s a little bit of fluid in between – they can use electron microscopy to see there’s been tremendous damage to the surfaces of the joints. But for some reason we don’t see that in the human joint. There’s something that makes it very resilient.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nInteresting stuff! So scientists have performed experiments to imitate what happens in a human joint when you crack your knuckles. And when you quickly pull apart a pair of ceramic – or clay – tiles with fluid between them, it causes a lot of damage to the surface of the tiles.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nSo why don’t human joints get damaged as well?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, the scientists don’t actually know. They can see the damage to the tiles using electron microscopy – that’s a very powerful microscope. But it’s not clear what makes the human joint so resilient to damage – and resilient in this context means returning to its original shape after being stretched or bent.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nRight. But with further research scientists may be able to find out – and then use this information to help people with joint problems.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nOr they could create synthetic – or man-made – materials which can withstand wear and tear better than current ones. Withstand means not be damaged by something and wear and tear means damage as a result of ordinary use.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nCan we have the answer to today’s quiz question now, Rob?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes, of course. So which type of joint can you crack? Is it … a) fibrous? b) cartilaginous? Or c) synovial?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd I said: c) synovial.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYou are quite clever actually because you are right, or was it a good guess?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nIt was a good guess.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell done! And synovial is the name for the fluid that surrounds this type of joint.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nOK. So can we hear the words we learned today again?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOf course. We heard:\nmake your flesh creep\narthritis\nan old wives’ tale\nrehabilitation\nMRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)\ninsight\nsoluble\nceramic\nresilient\nsynthetic\nwithstand\nwear and tear\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, that’s the end of today's 6 Minute English. We thought it was a cracking show! Please join us again soon.\n<strong>Both</strong>\n<br/>\nBye.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nGo on Neil, one more time.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nHere we go. (cracking knuckles) Feels great!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nHorrible!"

I'm Rob…\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\n… and I'm Neil. Hello.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nHello, Neil! Today we're talking about evolution. Now the man most people think of when talking about evolution is of course Charles Darwin. He was a bit of a genius, wasn’t he?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nHe was. Evolution means the way living things change and develop over millions of years. And a genius has great and unusual skills or abilities in a particular subject or area. Well Charles Darwin was a clever man but I happen to know that another man actually came up with the same idea, but many years before he did!\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nSo how do you know that then, clever clogs – that's someone who thinks they know everything? What was his name?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, his name was Patrick Matthew.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nOK, well we’re going to learn more about him on today’s programme. But first can you answer this, Neil? What was Patrick Matthew’s job? Was he …\na) a politician?\nb) a church minister?\nOr c) a horticulturalist?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, I don’t know so I'll go for the most profession that sounds most interesting - a horticulturalist, so I’ll choose that one! That’s a person who studies plants.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nOK. We’ll find out later whether you are right or wrong. But let’s listen now to Dr Mike Weale talking about Patrick Matthew. Can you hear the word he uses to mean 'change-making'?...\n<strong>INSERT</strong>\n<br/>\n<strong>Dr Mike Weale, geneticist at King’s College London</strong>\n<br/>\nHe published a brief outline of the idea of species being able to change into other species through natural selection – this great, transformative idea that unites us all in a single tree of life. And he did that 27 years before Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace did so. And they recognized that he did so but other people since then have simplified the story and tended to concentrate just on Darwin.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nSo, Matthew believed that evolution happened by natural selection. And natural selection describes the way that plants and animals adapt to their environment, because some individuals survive and reproduce, and others don’t.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd adapt means the way our bodies or our behaviour change to suit new conditions.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd what does Mike mean by ‘a single tree of life’?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, the basic idea behind evolution is that all the different species – or types of living thing – have evolved from the same simple life form. Just like a family tree describes how the members of your family are related to each other, so the ‘tree of life’ describes how all living things are related.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nSo if this was a transformative – or change-making – idea, why don’t more of us know about Patrick Matthew?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nA good question, Neil. We heard in the clip that Darwin acknowledged – or accepted - Matthew’s claim to the idea. But it seems to be down to us – the general public – wanting to simplify things.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, I like to keep things simple, Rob.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nYou don’t have to tell me that, Neil. But let’s hear more on why Matthew might have been passed over – or ignored – by some. Here’s Dr Patricia Fara, senior tutor at Clare College Cambridge. She tells us why Darwin was so successful. And listen out for the word she uses to mean close friends and supporters.\n<strong>INSERT</strong>\n<br/>\n<strong>Dr Patricia Fara, Senior Tutor at Clare College Cambridge</strong>\n<br/>\nHe brought his allies on board. And although he was publishing from his stronghold down in Kent he had the most famous, most prominent, eminent members of the scientific society in Victorian times who were pushing on his behalf. Having a scientific theory being accepted is not just a matter of whether the theory’s right.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nThe word she used was allies. What are they Neil?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nAllies are people who help or support us in something - having someone on board also means to have someone’s support for an idea or project. And Darwin’s allies weren’t just mates from down the pub, were they?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nNo, they weren’t! They were famous, prominent and eminent scientists. Prominent means important and well-known and eminent means important and respected.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nAh yes! So you could say that I’m an eminent radio presenter, Rob?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, I could Neil, but…\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nOK, OK, OK moving on! These eminent scientists were pushing on Darwin’s behalf. In other words, they were taking strong action to promote his theory of evolution.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd it’s possible that Patrick Matthew did not enjoy the same level of support.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nThat could be true. So do you remember the quiz question from the beginning of the show, Rob?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nIndeed I do! I asked: What was Matthew’s job? Was he … a) a politician? b) a church minister? Or c) a horticulturalist?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd I said c) horticulturalist.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nYes. And that was the right answer – so well done! Just to remind you: a horticulturalist is a person whose job is to study and grow plants such as flowers, fruit and vegetables. But Matthew was interested in trees too. In fact, his ideas about evolution appear in an appendix – or section giving extra information – at the end of a 200-page book about wood!\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nSo maybe that’s why we know Darwin’s name but not Matthew’s. It doesn’t seem fair.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, life’s not fair, Neil. You should know that by now!\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nI should, I should…\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nSo why don’t we hear the words we learned today?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nOK. Here we go:\nevolution\ngenius\nclever clogs\nnatural selection\nadapt\nspecies\ntransformative\npassed over\nallies\non board\nprominent\neminent\nhorticulturalist\nappendix\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThank you, Neil.

I'm Rob…\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\n… and I'm Neil. Hello.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nI'd like to start by asking how did you get up here to the studio - on to the sixth floor - this morning?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, by lift, of course.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nI thought so. That’s what we’re going to talk about in this programme - lifts. Or\n<strong>elevators</strong>\n, as Americans call them.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nLifts? That's not very exciting, is it? What’s there to say about lifts, Rob? I mean they take you up and down and that’s it really.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, you're in for a surprise, Neil – but first let's see if you can answer this question: Which country has the most lifts? Is it...\na) The USA?\nb) Italy?\nor c) China?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, it seems obvious to me because of the massive expansion in its construction industry, I'm going to say China.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOkay. Well, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. But now, let's\n<strong>elevate</strong>\n– or raise – your knowledge about lifts. This invention has had quite an effect on which floor people choose to live on.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, I suppose before the days of lifts rich people lived on the ground floor and poorer people lived on the top floors and had to use the stairs. Now though it's the other way round – and that, in turn, has given rise to penthouses with their fantastic views.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd the history of lifts goes back a long way. It was mathematician Archimedes who invented the first lift in 236BC. In the Middle Ages there were examples of lifts being used for military purposes. Then they helped to move agricultural products around. They really\n<strong>came into their own</strong>\n– or became very useful - in the Industrial Revolution.\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And there was a wide range of methods used to drive them, too – pulleys, water and steam power, electricity and so on. Today, tall <strong>blocks of flats</strong> couldn't exist without them. And you're right, Rob, <strong>there's more to lifts than meets the eye</strong>.  </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>There certainly is. But have you noticed how nobody says anything in a lift? Have you ever felt uneasy in a lift, Neil? </span>\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nActually yes, I have. Just this morning I was standing next to the big boss and neither of us knew what to say to each other.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes, it's a strange one, isn't it? Well, let's listen to Jason Whale, sales manager at Elevators Ltd, talking about this subject. He thinks he may have found a solution to the problem. He uses a word that describes the state of feeling strange or uneasy. Can you tell me what it is?\n<strong>Jason Whale, sales manager at Elevators Ltd<br/></strong>\nIt's a very anxious experience the time you spend in a lift. I think everyone behaves very differently and awkwardly in a lift. If you have things around you, you take away that\n<strong>awkwardness</strong>\n. We all look at our phones sometimes or look down at the floor. Well, surely it's better to look at advertisements on the walls…\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>He said <strong>awkwardness</strong>, which describes the state of feeling strange or uneasy. He suggests that advertisements in lifts could improve our experience of being in one. I suppose that could mean moving, digital ads.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It could, but before we consider that further, let's <strong>delve into</strong> lifts a little more. Of course there's always the danger of getting stuck in one – but thankfully that's rare and usually you can dial an emergency number and be rescued.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And did you know that most lifts mark the 13<sup>th</sup> floor as 12A or something similar because 13 is considered an unlucky number? By the way, have you heard of the elevator pitch?</span>\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes, I have Neil. It's something we can do when we're stuck in a lift with someone.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nYes - people say that if you have an idea or product to sell you should be able to sell it – or pitch it – to someone quickly. So in other words, in the time it takes for an elevator – or lift - to reach the top of a building.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nIt's a good idea if the lift doesn't break down! Let's get back to the thought that digital advertising can make travelling by lift a more pleasant experience.  Let's hear from Jason Whale again. He uses a word that means \"thinner\". Can you spot it?\n<strong><span>Jason Whale, sales manager at Elevators Ltd<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I think, with all things, as technology becomes both <strong>slimmer</strong> and also cheaper as well, it becomes much more attractive to people who purchase lifts and therefore there are so many different ways to <strong>enhance</strong> a lift with light boxes, with moving images, with television screens, it becomes quite exciting for us, and hopefully a little bit more interesting for the people who use lifts every day.</span>\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nHe said\n<strong>slimmer</strong>\nwhich means thinner.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd he said\n<strong>enhance</strong>\n, which means improve. Well, he could be on to something. Looking at moving advertisements must be better than listening to\n<strong>Muzak</strong>\n– that's non-stop, pre-recorded – usually boring - music.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nOh, that's terrible! I hate Muzak!\n<strong><span>Rob</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>OK. So Neil, do you remember the question I asked you at the beginning of the programme? I asked you which country has the most lifts? Is it...</span>\na) The USA?\nb) Italy?\nor c) China?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd I said c) of course. It must be, it has to be China!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nReally? You sound so sure... but in fact you're wrong. The answer is actually Italy. Does that surprise you?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nYeah. It astonishes me to be honest.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAll these old buildings that have got lifts in…\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nI wonder why.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, before we go, it's time to remind ourselves of some of the vocabulary that we've heard today. Neil.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\ncame into their own\nelevators\nelevate\nblocks of flats\nthere's more to lifts than meets the eye\nawkwardness\ndelve into\nlargely\nslimmer\nenhance\nMuzak\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThanks, Neil. Well, that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English. We hope you enjoyed today's programme. Please join us again soon. Bye bye.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nBye."

I'm Rob…</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>… and I'm Neil. Hello.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hello, Neil! Today we're talking about voting. Now I'm sure it's something you've done Neil?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Of course – and earlier this year we had a general election in the UK where I voted. </span>\n<span>And I'd feel guilty if I didn't exercise my right to vote. Now a <strong>right</strong> in this case means somebody's legal claim to vote.</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Rob<br/></strong>In a <strong>general election</strong> we vote for a government that runs the whole country, but we also have local and European elections too sometimes.  </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes but voting in the UK is optional – so you don't have to do it, whereas in some countries voting is compulsory - and <strong>compulsory</strong> means something that you have to do.   </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So if you were in Australia, where the government passed a law that made voting compulsory, you would have had to pay a fine of $20 for not voting.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And that's because the Australian government believes that voting is a duty and not just a right. </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span><strong>Duty</strong> means something you have a responsibility to do.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And it's your duty Rob to ask me today's quiz question!</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, sir! So can you tell me, what is a constituency? Is it …</span>\n<span>a) the people who live in and vote in a particular area?</span>\n<span>b) the politicians who make and change the laws of a country?</span>\n<span>or c) a town or district that has its own government?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well I'm no expert on politics… but I'm going to go for c) that's a town or district that has its own government.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK. Well, we'll find out later on in the show whether you're right or wrong. Now it's time to hear what a truly young person has to say about compulsory voting. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Oh right, unlike me you mean? Well, here's Michael Yip, who is a student at Warwick University and therefore much younger than me. </span>\n<strong><span>Michael Yip, student at Warwick University<br/></span></strong>\n<span>A lot of the people that I speak to just say 'I don’t care' or 'I don't really know what's going on' and in this way, another reason why I'm quite cautious about this is because it could sort of engender this sort of slapdash attitude towards politics where you know it’s sort of seen as, you know, being conscripted for national service … you just want to get it over and done with.</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">So Michael says he is cautious about the idea of introducing compulsory voting. So why is that, Neil? </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>He thinks forcing young people to vote will <strong>engender</strong> – or give rise to – a slapdash attitude. Now what does <strong>slapdash</strong> mean, Rob?</span>\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nIt's a good word, isn't it? It means doing something quickly and carelessly.\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Oh you've never do that, would you? Now, Michael compares compulsory voting to national service. <strong>National service</strong> is compulsory government service that usually means military service and is also known as <strong>conscription</strong>.</span>\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nSo when it's something you haven't chosen to do, or which you actively don't want to do – it's a case of getting it\n<strong> over and done with</strong>\n.\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">And that means finishing something difficult or unpleasant as quickly as possible.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Young people might just <strong>pick a political party out of a hat</strong> – which means to choose randomly – rather than making an informed choice. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So some people think that politicians need to improve political education. Now let's listen to broadcaster and writer Rick Edwards talking about this.</span>\n<strong>Rick Edwards, broadcaster and writer<br/></strong>\nIf you said to politicians, 'Right, 3.3 million first-time voters are definitely going to vote', then they will have to speak to them and they will have to make an effort to go to where they are and I think that's the change it would create.\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">So compulsory voting would mean a responsibility for the politicians too.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That's right. They need to engage and educate young people. Otherwise reluctant voters may deliberately <strong>spoil</strong> – or waste – their votes. </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>The government could also include a 'none of the above' option on the ballot paper. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Can you explain a bit more about that Rob?</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, it means you tick this option if you don't want to vote for any of the listed political parties.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>An interesting idea. Well my option for now is to get the answer to the quiz question.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK, well, I asked: What is a constituency? Is it … a) the people who live in and vote in a particular area? b) the politicians who make and change the laws of a country? Or c) a town or district that has its own government?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I said c) a town or district that has its own government.</span>\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, you ticked the wrong box, Neil! The answer is a) the people who live in and vote in a particular area. Now, did you know the UK is currently divided into 650 areas called parliamentary constituencies, each of which is represented by one MP in the House of Commons? And each constituency can have a different area. The largest is Ross, Skye and Lochaber in Scotland measuring approximately 12,000 square kilometres. The smallest constituency is Islington North in London measuring a little over seven square kilometres. Now, can we hear today's words again please, Neil?\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">OK. We heard:</span>\n<span>right</span>\n<span>general election</span>\n<span>compulsory</span>\n<span>duty</span>\n<span>engender</span>\n<span>slapdash</span>\n<span>national service</span>\n<span>conscription</span>\n<span>over and done with</span>\n<span>pick (a political party) out of a hat</span>\n<span>spoil</span>\n<strong><span>Rob</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>Splendid!

I'm Rob.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. Hello.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hi there, Neil. Hardly a day goes by without hearing someone talking about some aspect of our bodies. Do you know what I mean, Neil? </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh, yes, Rob. Almost every part of our anatomy seems to be the subject of endless debate. It could be our stomachs and what we eat. It could be our posture and how we stand. It could be our skin and how we should look after it.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, I know, it gets very <strong>tedious</strong> – that means boring – so I don't really take any notice, as you can see! But there’s one part of our body you don’t hear much about – and that is the chin.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span>\n<span>The chin? You mean the small bit of bone under the mouth? It’s not the most interesting part, is it Rob? I mean, it doesn’t do anything, does it? I must admit I’ve never even thought about it. What’s it for, anyway?</span>\n<strong><span>Rob</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>Well, some people think it’s very useful for folding up large sheets and towels. You know, you hold one end under your chin like that with it…</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Come on, Rob, you're not being serious!</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Of course not. But seriously, the more you think about it, the more interesting the chin becomes.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You’ve still got to convince me, Rob. A chin is just a chin. That’s all there is to it.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Not so fast, Neil.  The chin may turn out to be a more important part of the body than you think. But before we get into that, let’s turn to the quiz. <strong>Chin up</strong>, Neil. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>A good phrase - it means stay positive and optimistic.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK well how optimistic are you about getting this question right? How long ago do you think humans developed chins? Was it...</span>\n<span>a)</span>\n<span>150,000 years ago?</span>\n<span>b)</span>\n<span>2 million years ago? or</span>\n<span>c)</span>\n<span>5 million years ago?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span>\n<span>Hmm. I have no idea. They all sound <strong>far-fetched</strong> to me. Far-fetched means something is difficult to believe. But I think I’ll go for 2 million years ago.  </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>'B'. Okay. Well, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. </span>\n<span>But the first thing to say is that humans are the only animals to have developed a chin. Let’s listen to Dr James Pampush from the University of Florida. What word does he use to mean it sticks out?</span>\n<span><strong>Dr James Pampush from the Department of Anthropology at the University of Florida <br/></strong></span>\n<span>Humans are the only animal that have a chin and by that I mean, you have this bony <strong>projection</strong> underneath your teeth that sticks out past your teeth on the lower portion of your <strong>jaw</strong> and it’s such an unusual feature, that in a way it sort of helps define what it means to be human.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So he used the word <strong>projection</strong> which means something that sticks out from the main surface.  </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And the word <strong>jaw</strong> is used to describe the lower part of the face, which the chin is part of. So, we now know exactly what the chin is. But why did it develop?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now from what I understand, Rob, it has a lot to do with when humans started to cook their food, so the food they ate became much softer. Therefore, our <strong>ancestors</strong> – that’s the people related to us from a long time ago – they didn’t need powerful jaws or sharp teeth anymore. And, strangely, that made the jaw drop and produced that odd piece of bone we know as the chin.      </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>But some time later the chin became associated with sexual attraction in men. Males with <strong>prominent</strong> – that means easy to see - jaws were supposed to be attractive to women. And men with small chins were thought to be unattractive or weak people. They were even called <strong>chinless wonders</strong> sometimes.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Chinless wonder, an interesting phrase! So, let’s have a look at yours, Rob. Are you a chinless wonder? Mmm. Looks pretty normal to me. How about mine? </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, Neil, your chin is rather pointed if you don’t mind me saying. But I’m not sure what that means, to be honest. So, let’s move swiftly on. Let's hear what Dr Pampush has to say about this. He uses a word that means this theory is likely to be true.</span>\n<span><strong>Dr James Pampush from the Department of Anthropology at the University of Florida <br/></strong></span>\n<span>It seems <strong>plausible</strong> to me that chins emerged as some kind of feature and then later were selected to be sex ornaments. But not the presence of the chin but, rather, the shape of the chin being some kind of marker for sexual identity.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The word he used was<strong> plausible</strong> meaning something that is acceptable or believable. </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>The word chin has also given us some interesting expressions. A <strong>double chin</strong>, for example, describes loose skin hanging beneath the chin which makes people look like they’ve got two chins! It’s something that people don’t like and often try to get rid of.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And then there’s the verb to <strong>chinwag</strong>. That means to talk a lot or to chat in a relaxed way with friends. A chinwag tends to be a conversation about things that aren't very important – but our conversation about chins is very important!  </span>\n<strong><span>Rob</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>I guess so Neil, OK – so how about the answer to that question I asked you earlier? I asked you how long ago did humans develop chins? Was it a) 150,000 years ago? </span>\n<span>b) 2 million years ago or c) 5 million years ago?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said 2 million years ago.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>You know your chins, you were right. Well done! </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Ah brilliant!</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Chins really have been around for a long time. Now, before we go, it’s time to remind ourselves of some of the vocabulary that we’ve heard today. Neil.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>tedious</span>\n<span>chin up</span>\n<span>far-fetched</span>\n<span>projection</span>\n<span>jaw</span>\n<span>ancestors</span>\n<span>prominent</span>\n<span>chinless wonder</span>\n<span>plausible</span>\n<span>double chin</span>\n<span>chinwag</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Thanks Neil.

I'm Rob…</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And hello! I'm Neil.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hi there Neil. Have you ever had a close encounter with a monkey or an ape?  </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well I’m sitting right next to you, Rob?</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Very funny. Neil is referring to the fact that all humans are descended from apes, and apes and monkeys belong to a group of animals called <strong>primates</strong>.  The difference is that monkeys have tails, and apes don’t.  </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I didn’t know that. On a serious note… I had <strong>a close shave</strong> with some monkeys once in Bali.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>A close shave is where you only just manage to avoid a dangerous situation. So Neil, what happened?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I was walking up a mountain on my own and suddenly a bunch of monkeys jumped out of nowhere, blocking my path.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Oh goodness! OK. So what did you do?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>After standing there for ages while the monkeys screeched at me, I turned round and walked back the way I came.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK. If you <strong>screech</strong> at someone it means to make a loud, high and unpleasant sound. So the monkeys won that <strong>face-off</strong>, then!</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Absolutely! Yes, they did! And a face-off, by the way, means an argument or fight.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, today’s show is about gibbons and the different sounds they make. <strong>Gibbons</strong> are small apes that live in Southeast Asia. And while Neil’s monkeys screech unpleasantly, gibbons sound like they are singing.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Musical apes – that’s nice! So how about today’s quiz question, Rob?</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK, good idea. How far can a gibbon’s voice travel through the forest? Is it…</span>\n<span>a) 500m</span>\n<span>b) 1km</span>\n<span>or c) 5km?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Hmm. Well, I have to guess and I’m going to say b) 1km.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>You’ve never heard one.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Never heard one…</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK. We’ll find out later on in the programme whether you’re right or wrong. Now let’s listen to what a gibbon really sounds like.</span>\n<span><strong>Interview with Dr Esther Clarke, researcher at Durham University <br/></strong></span>\n<span><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Let’s just hear this. [gibbons calling] That’s an absolutely wonderful, evocative sound, isn’t it? Beautiful sound. And what are they doing there then? That is … I said talking to each other. </span>\n<span><strong>Dr Clarke:</strong> Well this is their… They’re singing together. So a male and a female, when they hold a territory together, will sing every morning what they call a duet. All the groups…</span>\n<span><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What we call a duet.</span>\n<span><strong>Dr Clarke:</strong> Yes, absolutely. And they’ll all sing together at the same time, and the whole forest will be alive with this cacophony of song.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span>\n<span>So the gibbons make an <strong>evocative</strong> sound. If something is evocative it brings strong feelings or memories to mind.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And something that is evocative is usually pleasant, Rob.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>It is. And what’s also interesting is that the apes are singing in pairs – one male and one female. They are singing <strong>duets</strong> together. So a duet is a song sung by two people – or in this case, sung by two gibbons!</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And a lot of gibbons are singing duets at the same time – which Dr Clarke describes as a <strong>cacophony</strong>. Cacophony means a mix of loud noises, which often sound out of tune.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And that could easily describe us singing together! </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Let’s not do that.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>But what’s the reason for the gibbon duets, Neil?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, the songs advertise the relationship between the male and the female. And they also help to make clear which <strong>territory</strong> – or bit of land – belongs to a pair or group of gibbons.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Gibbons also use different sounds to <strong>alert</strong> – or warn – other gibbons about danger from <strong>predators</strong> – these are animals that eat other animals. The gibbons use a quiet ‘hoo hoo’ call to communicate that a leopard is nearby, and an even quieter ‘hoo hoo’ call for an eagle.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>You’re very good at that Rob. </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Thank you.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Now let’s hear more from Dr Clarke about this. How does she describe language?</span>\n<strong><span>Dr Esther Clarke, researcher at Durham University</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>Yes, so the idea is that if we find things like context-specific calling in non-human primates, it suggests that way back in time the ancestor that we shared with them also had context-specific calling so basically it just gives us some clues [as] to the evolutionary roots of complex communication like language. </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Dr Clarke says that if we go far enough back in time humans and other primates such as monkeys and apes have the same <strong>ancestor</strong>. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Right. And ancestor means an animal – or human – from the past that a modern animal or human has descended from. So if this common ancestor used <strong>context-specific</strong> calls like modern gibbons – then it could have passed on this ability to humans a long time ago.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Context-specific calling means different calls for different situations, for example one call for ‘leopard’ and another for ‘eagle’.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And <strong>evolutionary</strong> means a gradual process of change or development.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK, let’s have the answer to the quiz question. Earlier I asked: How far can a gibbon’s voice travel through the forest? Is it: a) 500m b) 1km or c) 5km?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And I said b) 1km. </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And you were right! A good guess! Perhaps you do know a lot about gibbons. So well done! Now, can we hear today’s words again maybe in a gibbon's voice Neil?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I’m not sure about that. I’ll do it in a human voice. </span>\n<span>primates</span>\n<span>a close shave</span>\n<span>screech</span>\n<span>face-off</span>\n<span>gibbons</span>\n<span>evocative</span>\n<span>duet</span>\n<span>cacophony</span>\n<span>territory </span>\n<span>alert</span>\n<span>predators</span>\n<span>ancestor</span>\n<span>evolutionary</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Thank you.

I'm Rob…\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\n…and I'm Finn. Hello, Rob.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nHi there, Finn. I have to say you've got a lean and hungry look today!\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nOh really? I'll take that as a compliment, shall I?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nPlease do. Do you want a doughnut?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nActually, yeah – can I have two? So what are we talking about today, Rob?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWe're talking about\n<strong>skinny</strong>\n– or very thin – models and whether there should be a law banning them from working on the catwalk. And a\n<strong>catwalk</strong>\nis the long runway that models walk down at fashion shows.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWell, no danger there for me there Rob – I think I like eating a little bit too much.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd there's no danger of you becoming a model anyway, Finn – because you're not good looking enough, I'm afraid!\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nOh really. OK. Thank you, Rob. That's very nice of you. I think it's time for today's quiz question, please.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK – well, here goes. Which country banned the use of underweight models in 2013? Was it…\na) Israel\nb) Canada\nor c) the US\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYou know what? I've got no idea. So I'll take a guess and say a) Israel.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK. Well, we'll find out if that's the right answer later on. So come on, Finn, what do you think? Are the models we see on the catwalk and in the media too skinny?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWell, yeah, I think some models do look fantastic but others look painfully thin. Now, the\n<strong>media</strong>\n, by the way, refers to the different ways information is communicated to us, so, for example, through TV, radio, magazines, and often the internet and newspapers.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK. Well let's listen to Jamie Gavin, founder and managing director of media agency inPress, talking about a new French law being discussed, preventing the use of underweight models. Can you spot a phrase that means a limit or an ending?\n<strong>Jamie Gavin, founder and managing director of media agency inPress<br/></strong>\nI think it's a BMI of 18 or less, that's hopefully going to be banned by the French Assembly today. This is what the US health organization states as being kind of clinically unhealthy. So it's almost like a cut-off point. Yes, be thin, yes be thinner than the general population, but once it starts getting to unhealthy territory really that's time to start banning it.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nAnd the French Assembly did pass this law a few days later. Now, did you spot the phrase for a limit or an ending? It's\n<strong>cut-off point</strong>\n.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nSo models that are too thin will be\n<strong> banned</strong>\n– or won't be allowed – to work. And the cut-off point is a BMI of 18 or less.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nNow\n<strong> BMI</strong>\nstands for body mass index. And this is the ratio of a person's height to their weight.\n<strong>Ratio</strong>\nmeans the relationship between two things, showing how big one thing is compared to another.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nBut what happens if you're just naturally really thin? The authorities could be accused of\n<strong>discrimination</strong>\nagainst skinny people – or treating some people less fairly than others.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nThat's right. It's a good point. And that's why the French authorities and those of some other countries are using BMI as a way of deciding. So, models with a BMI of 18 or less weigh too little when compared to how tall they are.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd\n<strong>clinically</strong>\nunhealthy – what does that mean?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nIt means when you need medical treatment for a condition or illness.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nNow\n<strong>anorexia</strong>\nis an illness where a person refuses to eat in order to lose weight. But some models these days are so skinny they do look anorexic.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYou're right. Let's hear more from Jamie Gavin talking about protecting the health of models. What phrase is used to mean 'the responsibility'?\n<strong>Jamie Gavin, founder and managing director of media agency inPress<br/></strong>\nThe theatrical agents and the modelling agents that have got a responsibility to look after their clients. There's a huge amount of pressure on both the agent and on the models themselves and really the buck lies with them to make sure these people are healthy and that they're looking after their careers as well.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nSo the problem with the modelling industry is that the agents who employ the girls\n<strong>put pressure on</strong>\n– or strongly persuade – them to lose weight.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nAnd in this way they aren't taking care of their clients, they are actually putting them at risk. Now, why's that, Rob?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nIt's because many people in the fashion industry prefer very thin models so it's a case of\n<strong>supply and demand</strong>\n. The agents are simply supplying the fashion industry with the type of girls they want.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nRight. And what does the reporter mean when he says the buck lies with the agents?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWhen\n<strong>the</strong>\n<strong>buck lies – or stops – with someone</strong>\nit means it's his or her responsibility, not someone else's. And agents who employed underweight models can face fines of up to 75,000 euros, or even prison sentences.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nOK, shall we hear the answer to today's quiz question?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK. Well, I asked you which country banned the use of underweight models in 2013? Was it… a) Israel b) Canada or c) the US?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nI said a) Israel.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd you were right, Finn! Well done. Now, shall we listen to the words we learned today?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWe heard:\nskinny\ncatwalk\nmedia\ncut-off point\nbanned\nBMI (body mass index)\nratio\ndiscrimination\nclinically\nanorexia\nput pressure on\nsupply and demand\nthe buck stops with or the buck lies with\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThank you.

I'm Rob...\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\n...and I'm Finn. Hello.\n<strong>Rob                                                                  <br/></strong>\nHello, Finn. Did you have a good weekend?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYeah, it was OK thanks although, you know, I'm a bit tired now.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWhy's that?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nIt's a bit embarrassing but I stayed up all night playing a computer game.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAll night?! You must be addicted.\n<strong>Addicted</strong>\n, by the way, means unable to stop doing something.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWell, maybe today's programme might have some advice for me.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThat's right. Today we're discussing whether computer games are bad for our health - and in particular - bad for children.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nOK, Rob, why don't you wake me up a little bit by asking me today's quiz question?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK - here goes. In America, what percentage of people who play computer games are female? Is it...\na) 28%\nb) 38%\nor c) 48%\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWell, I do know a few female gamers so how about b) 38%.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK, right. Go for the middle option? We'll find out if that's the right answer later on. OK, so what kind of computer games do you like to play, Finn?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWell, I quite like those role-playing games. You know, the fantasy role-playing games.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK, well,\n<strong> role playing</strong>\nis where you create your own characters and stories in a\n<strong>fantasy</strong>\n- or imaginary - world. But, to be honest, those kind of games aren't really\n<strong>up my alley</strong>\n- which means they're not really suited to my tastes or abilities. Any other kind of games you like, Finn?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYeah, I also quite like\n<strong>shoot-'em-up</strong>\ngames. These are games where you have to do a lot of shooting and there's a lot of violence.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nIt's funny because you don't strike me as a violent person, Finn.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nI'm not, at all. I wouldn't hurt a fly, Rob! But maybe shooting people on a computer screen seems a bit more harmless.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK. And\n<strong> not to hurt a fly</strong>\nmeans to be gentle and unwilling to make people unhappy. And\n<strong>harmless</strong>\nmeans unlikely to hurt or upset anyone. Well, let's hear Internet safety advisor Alan MacKenzie discussing how adult computer games can have a negative effect on children.\n<strong>Alan MacKenzie, internet safety advisor<br/></strong>\nMany people understandably will just think that a game is just a game and not realising the explicit content that's in there - and as you suggest, the violence and sexualisation of women in particular, which is wholly inappropriate for anybody, never mind children.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWell, you know, if you want my opinion, Rob, a game is just a game. It's generally a harmless form of entertainment. What do you think?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\n<strong>I'm torn</strong>\n, actually - meaning I'm unable to decide. Most people, like you Finn, probably aren't affected by what you see in computer games. But we can't ignore the small percentage of people who are affected.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWell, that's true really, isn't it, Rob? And whilst playing computer games all night doesn't make me violent, it certainly makes me very tired!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nI can see that. But also Finn - when do you and your wife actually talk to each other - when you're in your own computer fantasy world for hours on end?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYeah, it's not great, is it? And\n<strong>for hours on end</strong>\nmeans a long time, by the way! So, I don't know. Maybe if she played as well, then we could have some virtual conversations...\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, that sounds ridiculous! But let's move on. Alan talks about\n<strong>explicit content</strong>\nin games. What does that mean?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nThat means showing things in an open and direct way. So some adult games contain open violence and sexualisation.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd shall we explain what\n<strong>sexualisation</strong>\nmeans?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYes. It means making someone or something sexual - and in this case, women. This might be through the shape of a woman's body, or the clothes she wears, or the way she behaves in these games.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAlan says this type of explicit content - violent or sexual - is inappropriate for computer games. And\n<strong>inappropriate</strong>\nmeans not the right thing for a particular situation.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nAnd he is worried about children accessing this type of content. Let's hear more from him. What advice does he give?\n<strong>Alan MacKenzie, internet safety advisor<br/></strong>\nSo it's a matter of educating the parents and the wider community in these issues, and making them aware of the type of content that's in there, and why it's inappropriate, and the effects that it may be having on their children and their behaviour.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nAlan thinks it's the responsibility of parents and the\n<strong>wider community</strong>\n- now that means other groups of people, such as friends, relatives and teachers for example - to check on what children are viewing and playing.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nBut this will only work if they understand which types of content are OK and which aren't.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nThat's right. So the adults need educating too. They need to be shown.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes, that's right. So I'll be checking on your behaviour from now on, Finn!\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nOK, That's probably a good idea. So, let's hear the answer to today's quiz question next.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes and I asked you, in America, what percentage of people who play computer games are female? Is it... a) 28% b) 38% or c) 48%?\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nAnd I went for the middle option, as usual, and I said b) 38%.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd you are wrong, this time Finn! The answer is actually c) 48%. Are you surprised by that?\n<strong>Finn</strong>\n<br/>\nYes and no. I think a lot more people are playing games in general, so lots of them must be women.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nAbsolutely. Why not? OK, shall we now listen to the words we learned today?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nGood idea. We heard:\naddicted\n<br/>\nfantasy\n<br/>\nup your alley\n<br/>\nshoot 'em up\n<br/>\nnot to hurt a fly\n<br/>\nharmless\n<br/>\nfor hours on end\n<br/>\nexplicit content\n<br/>\nsexualisation\n<br/>\ninappropriate\n<br/>\nwider community\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThank you.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me today is Finn. Hello, Finn.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nHi Rob!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nIn this programme we're going to be talking about blood.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYes. Blood? Did I ever tell you, Rob, that I really hate the sight of blood? And I've even been known to\n<strong>faint</strong>\n– that's to lose consciousness - at the sight of a needle.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nCome on, Finn. I think you've got a lot to learn. You wouldn't be here without it, you know! It's a fascinating topic. All sorts of discoveries are being made these days, which could change medical science for ever.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYes. Well, you are right, of course. Blood was even thought to relate to human character. People were hot-bloodied – quick to anger – or cold-bloodied – lacking in passion.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThere were all the myths about vampires when young blood was thought to revitalise older people. There's a dreadful story that a Hungarian countess had hundreds of young women killed so she could bathe in their blood and stay youthful-looking.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nRight. OK. And in Roman times, if a young gladiator died in battle, people used to drink his blood because they thought it would keep them healthy.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nFor 3,000 years, people have been cut or given leeches to let out the blood because they thought that would make people better. Incredibly, it carried on until the 19th century. But it actually made people worse, or even killed them.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nSo I won't be doing that today.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK. Instead, how about answering a question all about blood Finn?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nGo on then.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nIf you laid out all the blood vessels in an adult body end to end how long would they be? Would they be…\na)      30,000 miles\nb)      100,000 miles or\nc)      200,000 miles long?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWell, let's say 100,000 miles. That's b).\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK. Well, we'll see if you got the right answer at the end of the programme. OK, well let's talk more about blood now. We've heard about blood in history but Finn, did you know that today beauticians are running businesses in which people pay to have their blood extracted, then injected into their face?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYes I have heard about this. It's thought to\n<strong>rejuvenate</strong>\n– that's to give new life to - their skin. Michael Mosley has had just that done to his face as an experiment. He's a doctor and presenter with the BBC. Let's listen to him talking about it. He uses an expression that means \"go faster\". Can you tell me what it is?\n<strong>Michael Mosley, TV presenter and doctor<br/></strong>\nSometimes known as the Vampire Facelift, PRP – Platelet Rich Plasma therapy – claims to\n<strong>accelerate</strong>\nhealing and reverse the signs of ageing. First my blood is\n<strong>treated </strong>\nto make a concentrated solution of platelets in plasma. Next, this is injected directly into my face.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nOuch! And the word he used was \"accelerate\". Now that means to make faster.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd he said they \"treated\" his blood. This means \"changed or transformed\" it.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWell, today, of course, controlled blood\n<strong>transfusion</strong>\nis a completely normal medical practice that saves countless lives. And blood donors – the people who give their blood – are an important part of healthcare.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes, Finn, but there's all sorts of other amazing things that blood can do. If we are running at altitude – high up - the limbs get tired because there's not enough oxygen. The blood then starts creating new red cells and pours them into the system. That's why athletes often train in the mountains.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nAltitude training, isn't it? And, apparently, the different types of food you eat have an immediate effect on your blood, or rather the element of blood called plasma. So, if you eat a\n<strong>cholesterol-high</strong>\nbreakfast, for example, very soon after that you can see the fat in the blood.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nNice. Ideas about how blood moves around your body have changed a lot over the years too. The Romans thought blood flowed one way and came out of our feet and hands and was then burnt away. But William Harvey in the 17thcentury found that blood circulated via\n<strong>veins and arteries</strong>\n– these are the tubes in our body where blood is carried around.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nAnd let's not forget\n<strong>clotting</strong>\n– that's when the blood hardens. If our blood didn't clot when we cut ourselves we'd be dead within minutes. It is really fascinating isn't it? And we're just beginning to understand\n<em>stem cells</em>\n. These are also in the blood and are used to repair various organs in the body\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nModern science is really helping us to understand blood properly for the first time and showing us the way forward.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nNow Rob, before my blood boils, could you let me know the answer to the quiz question Rob?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes. So, I asked you if you laid out all the blood vessels in an adult body end to end how long would they be: 30,000 miles, 100,000 miles or 200,000 miles?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWell, I said 100,000 miles.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWow. And you know your blood vessels, because you got that question right.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWell, I measured them earlier.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nGood. And how do you feel about blood now?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWell, I'm probably a bit scared of it still. But now that I know all of these wonderful things that it does, I really get why it's so important.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nGreat. So, let's remind ourselves of some of the words we've said today, Finn.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nHere we are:\nfaint\nrejuvenate\ntransfusion\ncholesterol-high\nveins and arteries\nclotting\naccelerate\ntreated\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThank you. Well, that's it for today. Please visit\n<a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>\nto find more 6 Minute English programmes. Until next time.

I'm Rob...\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\n...and I'm Finn. Hello.\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nHello, Finn! Are you chewing gum over there?\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nYeah. Oh hang on – I'll just stick it under the desk for now.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYuck – that's revolting! Why don't you go and put it in the bin? Since when did you take up this antisocial habit?\n<strong>Antisocial</strong>\nmeans annoying to other people, by the way.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYeah, well. OK, Rob. Fine. Since I heard that there was evidence that chewing gum can improve your brain.\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nSo how does it do that?\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nWell, some experts say that the chewing action can lead to an increase in blood flow to the brain.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nInteresting! And guess what, we're taking about chewing gum on today's programme! So here's a question for you, Finn. When did the Singapore government outlaw chewing gum? Was it in...\na) 1982?\n<br/>\nb) 1992?\n<br/>\nor c) 2002?\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nAnd just before I answer,\n<strong>to</strong>\n<strong>outlaw</strong>\n<strong>something</strong>\nmeans to make it illegal. Well, I think the answer is a) 1982.\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nWell, we'll chew on it for a while, shall we, and find out if you're right at the end of the programme.\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nSo, Rob, what's the history of chewing gum?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, people have been chewing gum for thousands of years. The Ancient Greeks chewed gum made from\n<strong>resin</strong>\n– a sticky substance produced by trees. But why do people like chewing gum?\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nWell, for many people it's just something to do. But you know, I like the idea that it's good for my brain. Research has shown that people find gum chewers are also more\n<strong>approachable</strong>\n– that means they're friendlier and easier to talk to.\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nOK. Well, there might be some truth in that. The thing we're here to discuss today, though, is how to\n<strong>dispose</strong>\n– or get rid – of gum responsibly. And you didn't set a very good example earlier in the show, did you, Finn?\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nAh, well. Yeah, no, I didn't. But lots of people dispose of gum irresponsibly – that means not responsibly. It's often found stuck underneath tables, chairs, benches and escalators. And it's really difficult and expensive to remove once it has dried.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nRight – because gum actually creates a\n<strong>chemical bond</strong>\n– which means when one thing joins firmly to another. For example it bonds with tarmac roads, rubber shoe soles, and concrete paving.\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nSo how do we remove dried gum from roads and pavements? Rob, how would you do it?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, people do use high-pressure steam cleaners and then they scrape it off. But it's a slow process that's\n<strong>labour-intensive</strong>\n– which means it takes a lot of people to do it.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nI'm sure it does. So let's hear someone telling a BBC reporter about why they threw their gum away in the street. Can you hear the reason she gives?\n<strong>INSERT<br/></strong>\nWoman: Not that often. I often put it in the bin.\n<br/>\nReporter: But you do it sometimes?\n<br/>\nWoman: Yeah, sometimes.\n<br/>\nReporter: Why do you do it sometimes?\n<br/>\nWoman: I don't know. Because there's no bins around.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nNow, she says she throws her gum in the street when she can't find a bin.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nSo, why doesn't she put it in her pocket and wait until she finds a bin?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nAh, no. No way, man! That's – that would make her pocket sticky!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOh dear – it sounds like you and her are\n<strong>two of a kind</strong>\n– and that means very similar. OK, well, let's find out what another gum chewer does.\n<strong>INSERT<br/></strong>\nReporter: If you're walking along the street, and you had some other, a packet of crisps, when you'd finished it, would you throw that away?\n<br/>\nMan: Not really.\n<br/>\nReporter: So why do you sometimes throw the chewing gum away? What's the difference?\n<br/>\nMan: It's like food. It's not like a wrapper. Do you know what I mean?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nSo, this guy says gum is like food, so it's OK to drop it on the ground. Do you agree, Rob?\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nNo, I don't. Food, such as a discarded apple core or banana skin, quickly and naturally\n<strong>degrades</strong>\n– or breaks down. And other types of litter, for example, a crisp packet or a sweet wrapper, can be picked up easily.\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nThat's right. Whereas chewing gum is a bit like glue once it dries and it's extremely difficult to remove. So, in this way, of course, it can also be environmentally damaging.\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nIn 2000 a study of a busy London shopping street showed that a quarter of a million pellets of chewing gum were stuck to the pavement. And a\n<strong>pellet</strong>\nis a small round ball of something that has become hard.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nThat's a lot of pellets, isn't it! The amount of discarded gum in Singapore was considered to be such a problem that the government banned the sale and consumption of gum altogether. They said it was because people were sticking their gum in the sliding doors of subway trains, stopping the doors from opening and closing.\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nYes, it's a sticky subject isn't it?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nIt is indeed. A sticky situation, Rob.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd that brings us on to today's quiz question! I asked you earlier: when did the Singapore government outlaw chewing gum? Was it in… a) 1982? b) 1992? or c) 2002?\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nI said a) 1982.\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nYou are wrong, Finn, just for today. The answer is actually b) 1992.\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nWhich means the people of Singapore could chew gum for ten more years than I said. That's good. Now, how about those words again, Rob?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK, well, the words we heard today were:\nantisocial\n<br/>\nto outlaw something\n<br/>\nresin\n<br/>\napproachable\n<br/>\nchemical bond\n<br/>\nlabour-intensive\n<br/>\ntwo of a kind\n<br/>\ndegrades\n<br/>\npellet\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWell, that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English. We hope you've had plenty to chew on in today's programme. And you can hear more programmes at\n<a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\">bbclearningenglish.com</a>\n.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me today is Finn. Hello, Finn.\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nHi Rob!\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nIn this programme we're going to be talking about food banks in the UK.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYes, food banks. But what exactly are they?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, you can find them all over the country nowadays. They're part of a system where people who are struggling financially are given free food to cook or eat which other people have donated – or given for free.\n<strong>Finn</strong>\n<br/>\nWe mean that people in modern-day Britain are so hard-up – that means they've got so little money – that they can't afford to buy their own food? It does seem extraordinary, doesn't it?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nYeah, it does. Well, today's question is about the people who use the food banks. So Finn, do you know how many British people are estimated to have used them? Is it…\na) 15,000?\nb) 240,000?\nor c) 500,000?\n<strong>Finn</strong>\n<br/>\nI'll say 240,000, Rob.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, we'll see if you're right at the end of the programme. Let's talk now about why food banks have opened up in the UK.\n<strong>Finn</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, well, I suppose one place to start is the financial crisis of 2008 which\n<strong>made a lot of people</strong>\n<strong>redundant </strong>\n– that means they were asked to leave their jobs by their companies – so they became unemployed.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nThen there were the cuts to the welfare system in 2013 which added to the problem.\n<strong>Finn</strong>\n<br/>\nRising food prices themselves are another reason. And heating bills in the winter can be expensive. People fall into debt. You know, lots of things.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd remember that it's not just unemployment, Finn, but underemployment, too. There are some people on what is called\n<strong>zero-hours contracts</strong>\nand doing part-time work and they don't earn enough money to buy some of the essential things in life.\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nSo there really are a lot of different factors, aren't there.\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nWell, let's listen to Steph Hagen as she explains how her food bank in Nottingham works. She uses an expression that means 'unlimited access'.\n<strong>Steph Hagen</strong>\n<br/>\nPeople do not go to a food bank because it's an\n<strong>open door</strong>\n, it's an open shop. It's a case of they go to it because they need to. And also with our food bank – we are an independent one, and we have\n<strong>limited stocks</strong>\n– so everybody who comes through our door has no income whatsoever.\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nShe said \"open door\". This means unlimited access.\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nAnd she said she had \"limited stocks\". This means 'a shortage of goods' – there's not enough food for everybody.\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nBut Rob, surely this food bank system is open to abuse as well? What's to stop anyone just turning up and asking for food?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, there are checks in place and there's a system of\n<strong>referrals</strong>\n. If a doctor or a social worker thinks someone needs to use a food bank – even for a short time – they can give them vouchers. Then they take the vouchers along to the food bank and they get\n<strong>handouts</strong>\nfor three days.\n<strong>Finn</strong>\n<br/>\nRight. So, I see. I've heard that everything in food banks is donated – that means it's given for free. And churches and individual donors are the people who provide most of it.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, apparently, these food banks are a great meeting place for people who are lonely and depressed. The food bank volunteers then talk to the people who use them.\n<strong>Finn</strong>\n<br/>\nSome of these food banks also run courses about how to cook well on a low budget. So it's really not just handouts that these people get. It's information as well.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nBut because these people are poor they often can't afford to use gas or electricity for cooking. So the food banks make sure they also provide food which can be eaten cold.\n<strong>Finn</strong>\n<br/>\nThat's right. And I think it would be wrong to assume that the users are just\n<strong>scroungers </strong>\n– now that means people who want something for nothing – because there's a loss of\n<strong>dignity</strong>\nand even shame attached to using these services and people would of course prefer not to have to do it. So, what food do they give out, Rob?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, let's listen to Steph again and see what she says. She uses an expression to describe canned food that only needs to be heated.\n<strong>Steph Hagen<br/> </strong>\nBasically, we've got porridge. We do occasionally get fresh produce but it's very rare, especially in the winter months. It's a case of, it's like, tinned fruit,\n<strong>tinned ready meals</strong>\n. What also\n<strong>goes into the mix</strong>\n, people don't realise we have to give out 'no-cooking' food parcels because people can't afford the gas and electric...\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nShe said \"tinned ready meals\". This is canned food that only needs to be heated.\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nAnd she said \"goes into the mix\". This means it's 'part of the overall package'. She also made the point about the importance of giving out 'no-cooking' food parcels because some people don't have the electricity or the gas to cook the food. OK, Finn. So, would you like the answer to the quiz question now?\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nYes, please, yes. You asked me how many British people are estimated to have used food banks. Was it: 15,000, 240,000 or 500,000? And I guessed 240,000.\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nWell, sorry, Finn. I'm afraid the answer is actually 500,000. And some experts say that there are 13 million people living below the poverty line in the UK right now.\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nIt really does show how food banks – even in a country like ours – are really needed. It does make you think, doesn't it?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nIt does. Well, we're almost out of time now. So, let's remind ourselves of some of the words we've said today, Finn.\n<strong>Finn<br/> </strong>\nOK.\nmake people redundant\nzero-hours contracts\nopen door\nreferrals\nhandouts\nlimited stocks\nscroungers\ndignity\nready meals\ngoes into the mix\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nThank you.

I'm Neil…\n<strong>Rob                                                                    <br/> </strong>\n… and I'm Rob. Hello.\n<strong>Neil                                         <br/> </strong>\nHello, Rob. I like your new hoody.\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nOh, right! Thanks a lot. A\n<strong>hoody</strong>\nis a sweatshirt with a hood, by the way. You don't think I'm too old for hoodies, do you?\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nNever. No, no. You too old? Never, Rob! It’s all about how young you feel inside, isn't it?\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nIs that right? Well, I don’t feel a day over sixteen, Neil.\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nExcellent! Now, that might help you because in this programme we’re talking about the teenage brain! So, are you ready for today's quiz question, Rob?\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nYes, I am Neil. Fire away.\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nOK. What part of the brain is connected with basic emotions? Is it the…\na) prefrontal cortex?\n<br/>\nb) cerebral cortex?\n<br/>\nor c) limbic sytem?\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\nOK. I was terrible at biology – I never listened in class. So I'm going to have to take a guess and say the answer is a) prefrontal cortex.\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nOK, well. We’ll find out if that’s the right answer at the end of the programme. Now Rob, were you a well-behaved student?\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\nWell, I wasn't badly behaved. But we had a horrible school uniform and sometimes I got\n<strong>detention </strong>\njust for having my shirt hanging out.\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nWell, that's pretty harsh! Detention means having to stay at school after the day to do extra work.\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\nYes it was a punishment for doing something wrong. Now some people think that typical teenage behaviour such as embarrassment, anxiety, mood swings and risk taking is caused by changing hormones.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\n<strong>Mood swings</strong>\nare sudden changes of mood and\n<strong>hormones</strong>\nare chemicals in the body that stimulate cells and organs into action.\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\nYes. I bet you were a moody teenager, Neil!\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nI might have been (in a teenage voice)… no, let's not go there, Rob. Now, apparently, it’s not only our hormones that change when we reach\n<strong>adolescence</strong>\n– that’s the age when we start changing into an adult.\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\nThat's right. According to scientific research, some teenage behaviour is probably caused by changes in the brain. Let's listen to Professor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore talking about this. What's the phrase she uses to mean 'to enjoy'?\n<strong>INSERT</strong>\n<br/>\n<strong><span>Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London<br/></span></strong>\nThere's a pretty established theory of risk taking – the biological basis of risk taking – which is that two different systems in the brain developed at different rates. The parts of the brain called the limbic system, which includes the regions of the brain that give you a rewarding feeling out of taking a risk, a kind of kick out of taking a risk, and an emotion out of taking a risk, are developing more quickly than the part of the brain called the pre-frontal cortex, which inhibits risk taking.\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nSo what risks do teenagers typically take?\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\nWell. The things most parents worry about, such as drinking, smoking, possibly taking drugs, and driving too fast.\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nAnd the reason that they take these risks might be because the area of the brain that rewards risk-taking behaviour develops more quickly than the area of the brain that\n<strong>inhibits</strong>\n– or slows down – risk-taking behaviour.\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\nAnd what was the phrase she used to mean 'enjoy something'?\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nIt was to\n<strong>get a kick out of something</strong>\n. Teenagers 'get a kick out of' and are rewarded for taking risks by one part of the brain – the\n<strong> limbic system</strong>\n– while the other part – the\n<strong>pre-frontal cortex</strong>\n– does little to slow things down.\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\nWell, that sounds more fun than being an adult. But actually, we often give teenagers a hard time. Let's hear more about this from Sarah-Jayne.\n<strong><span>Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London<br/></span></strong>\nSomething that I've noticed since working with teenagers is that they are the butt of many jokes. And they're parodied left, right and centre. They're demonized in newspapers. And whenever I tweet anything about the teenage brain – which I do quite frequently – invariably, inevitably, I'll get a reply from someone saying, 'Oh, what, teenagers actually have brains?'\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nNow of course some teenagers are very brainy –\n<strong>brainy</strong>\nis another way of saying clever. I know young people who are brilliant at maths, art and science.\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\nBut we heard Sarah-Jayne describe teenagers as being the\n<strong>butt of a joke</strong>\n– that means to be its target. And if you\n<strong>parody</strong>\nsomeone you copy their style in an exaggerated way to make people laugh.\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nAnd\n<strong>to</strong>\n<strong>demonize</strong>\na person or a group means to talk about them as if they were evil or threatening. Poor teenagers, Rob!\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\nOh, don't worry, Neil – they'll grow up and be like us one day! And now it's time to hear the answer to today’s quiz question.\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nYes it is. I asked you, what part of the brain is connected with basic emotions? Is it the… a) prefrontal cortex? b) cerebral cortex? or c) limbic system?\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nAnd I chose a) prefrontal cortex. Was I right?\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nWell. I'm afraid to say, Rob, that you were absolutely wrong.\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\nUsing the wrong part of my brain, obviously.\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nYes. The answer is c) the limbic system. But don't get too emotional about getting that wrong and instead, please remind us of the words we learned today?\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\nGood idea. We heard:\n<span>hoody<br/></span>\ndetention\n<br/>\nhormones\n<br/>\nadolescence\n<br/>\ninhibits\n<br/>\nget a kick out of something\n<br/>\nlimbic system\n<br/>\nprefrontal cortex\n<br/>\nbrainy\n<br/>\nbutt of a joke\n<br/>\nparody\n<br/>\nto demonize\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nWell, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Neil...\n<strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>\n...and I'm Catherine. Hello.\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nHello, Catherine! Now, how was your holiday?\n<strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>\nMy holiday was lovely, Neil. I was staying on a beautiful island. It was very remote and there was actually no internet access. So, I did feel quite cut off actually.\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nAnd\n<strong>cut off</strong>\nmeans isolated. How did you survive, Catherine?\n<strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>\nWell, it wasn’t easy. But I had my\n<strong>e-reader</strong>\n- that's an electronic device which lets you store and read lots of books from the internet. And I read a lot of Harry Potter...\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nHarry Potter? I know you like wizards, Catherine, but shouldn't you have downloaded some classic literature? How about Shakespeare’s The Tempest? That's got a wizard in it too.\n<strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>\nWell, yes indeed. But Shakespeare on the beach isn't quite right for me, Neil.\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nRight. Well, today we're talking about how the poorer and more\n<strong>remote</strong>\n- or distant - parts of the world can get access to learning.\n<strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>\nThat's right. But before we start, Neil, I believe you have a quiz question for us.\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nYes, I do. I would like to know what the proportion of the world's population that still has no internet access is. Is it...\n<span>a) a quarter?<br/></span>\nb) half?\n<br/>\nor c) two thirds?\n<strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>\nI'm going to go for c) two thirds.\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nWell, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on in the programme. So Catherine, how can these people get connected to the internet and start surfing?\n<strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>\nBy using the Outernet.\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nThe Outer what?\n<strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>\nThe Outernet. That's the idea of entrepreneur Syed Karim and its goal is to give people in unconnected communities access to information without having to use expensive mobile phones or two-way satellite networks.\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nI see. And an\n<strong>entrepreneur</strong>\n, by the way, is a person who makes money by starting their own business that typically involves some financial risk.\n<strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>\nYes, I've always fancied myself as a bit of an entrepreneur.\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nWell, you'll need money and ideas, Catherine. Have you got either of those?\n<strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>\nI've got ideas.\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nRight. OK. I get it.\n<strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>\nSo, can you tell us how the Outernet works, Neil?\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nYes, I can. The Outernet uses existing communications satellites to store and broadcast data -\n<strong>broadcast</strong>\nmeans to send out signals or programmes. Special equipment on the ground\n<strong>picks up</strong>\n- or receives - the data, and this can be copied to phones and computers.\n<strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>\nBut the Outernet broadcasts data\n<strong>offline</strong>\n- which means it's not connected to the Internet. There's no communication with the internet for user - so, no emails, no chat forums. And that can be a big\n<strong>drawback</strong>\n- or disadvantage.\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nYes. The Outernet doesn't provide two-way communication. But let's hear Syed Karim discussing why one-way access has some advantages. And see if you can spot another word meaning 'two-way'.\n<strong>INSERT</strong>\n<br/>\n<strong><span>Syed Karim, business entrepreneur<br/></span></strong>\nAnything that is related to bi-directional communications, the internet, to be able to provide that to the entire world, those are billion dollar projects, multi-billion dollar projects with huge time horizons and enormous complexity. And, you know, our solution that we are offering is instantaneous, I mean, it exists right now.\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nDid you get it? Another way of saying two-way is\n<strong>bi-directional</strong>\n. So what are the advantages of\n<strong>one-way</strong>\ncommunication, Catherine?\n<strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>\nIt's significantly cheaper. Bi-directional communications are multi-billion dollar projects. But the Outernet allows poorer communities to benefit from access to information.\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nYes, it does. And the other big problem is the time it would take to establish two-way access. Syed says these projects have huge\n<strong>time horizons</strong>\n- and this means the length of time it takes to complete a project - they're huge, so very big.\n<strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>\nBut the Outernet is already providing access to some of the world's most valuable knowledge.\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nThat's right. The project aims to create a library of information taken from websites including Wikipedia and Project Gutenberg, which is a collection of copyright-free e-books.\n<strong>Copyright-free</strong>\nmeans the right to use material without paying any fees.\n<strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>\nThat sounds good. But let's go back to the internet and hear from a BBC reporter talking about another project which aims to get people connected.\n<strong>INSERT</strong>\n<br/>\n<strong><span>BBC reporter<br/></span></strong>\nGoogle for example is working on Project Loon, a network of high-altitude helium balloons, which will boost Internet connections across much wider areas beyond coverage from conventional masts.\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nIt's called Project\n<strong>Loon</strong>\n- meaning crazy - because Google thought it was such a crazy idea, and loon sounds like balloon!\n<strong>Catherine<br/></strong>\nYeah. The idea is that users will connect to the\n<strong>balloon network</strong>\n- or group of interconnected balloons - using an antenna attached to their building. The signal travels through the balloon network from balloon to balloon, and then to a station on the ground that's connected to the Internet.\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nThe balloons will\n<strong>boost</strong>\n- or increase - the number of people who will be able to access the Internet.\n<strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>\nYes, it will. And that's because there will be lots of them - compared to the number of\n<strong>masts</strong>\n- or tall metal towers that send and receive signals - that are currently used.\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nOK, let's have the answer to the quiz question I asked: What proportion of the world's population still has no internet access? Is it ... a) a quarter? b) half? or c) two thirds?\n<strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>\nAnd I said c) two thirds.\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nAnd you were right! The answer is two thirds. Well done, Catherine.\n<strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>\nThank you.\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nNow just time to listen to today's words once again. Catherine.\n<strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>\nOK. We heard:\n<span>e-reader<br/></span>\nremote\n<br/>\nentrepreneur\n<br/>\nbroadcast\n<br/>\npicks up\n<br/>\ndrawback\n<br/>\nbi-directional\n<br/>\none-way\n<br/>\ntime horizons\n<br/>\ncopyright-free\n<br/>\nballoon network\n<br/>\nboost\n<br/>\nmasts\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\nWell, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

But one thing that makes me regularly angry is when people put the wrong rubbish in the wrong bins.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, that makes me angry too.\n<strong>Catherine</strong>\n<br/>\nDoes it?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nIt's not very thoughtful, is it?\n<strong>Catherine</strong>\n<br/>\nNot really, no.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nSo, you may feel angry about people putting rubbish in the wrong bin but do you get\n<strong>aggressive</strong>\n? That's behaving in an angry way, looking like you want to argue or even fight with someone?\n<strong>Catherine</strong>\n<br/>\nNo. I don't really get aggressive about wheelie bins, to be honest.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell I tend to control my anger too and keep calm but I have been known to react - especially if someone is damaging some of my property.\n<strong>Catherine</strong>\n<br/>\nWow. Really?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nYeah. I can't stand it. It comes\n<strong>out of the blue</strong>\n– it's completely unexpected. But I'm glad to say I feel quite calm today.\n<strong>Catherine</strong>\n<br/>\nI'm glad to hear it, Neil. But today we are talking about aggression and we'll look at what we can learn about human aggression by some examples from the animal kingdom.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nThat's right. Now, are you ready to answer today's quiz question, Catherine?\n<strong>Catherine</strong>\n<br/>\nIn a very calm and non-aggressive way, I would like you to give me the question.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWhen attacked, what does a baboon typically do to show aggression? Does it…\n<br/>\na) beat its chest\n<br/>\nb) yawn and show its teeth\n<br/>\nor c) laugh and roll on the ground\n<strong>Catherine</strong>\n<br/>\nWell… I'd love to think of an angry baboon laughing and rolling on the ground. But I'm going to go for b) yawn and show its teeth.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nOK. Well, we'll see if you right or wrong a bit later on. Now, Catherine, how do you usually act when you're angry or upset about something?\n<strong>Catherine</strong>\n<br/>\nI generally let people know how I feel to be honest. I don't go over the top and hit people, but also I don't sulk about things. And\n<strong>sulk</strong>\nmeans when you refuse to smile or speak because you want to let people know you are upset about something.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nSulking is quite childish, isn't it Catherine?\n<strong>Catherine</strong>\n<br/>\nIt is. Are you a sulker, Neil?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nI don't sulk, I don't think. But as I said I don't often get angry. I'm a very well balanced and grounded person, Catherine.\n<strong>Catherine</strong>\n<br/>\nReally, very good. I'm pleased to hear it, Neil. Anyway,\n<strong>well balanced</strong>\nmeans sensible and in control of your emotions. And\n<strong>grounded</strong>\nmeans mentally and emotionally stable. Is that what you're saying, Neil?\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, that's me. But let's listen to Professor Simon Underdown talking about human behaviour. Can you spot a phrase that means 'the opposite side to an idea'?E\n<strong>INSERT</strong>\n<strong>Simon Underdown, Principal Lecturer in Human evolution at Oxford Brookes University</strong>\n<br/>\nOne of the things humans are incredibly good at doing is being psychologists. We'e very good at reading situations that we find ourselves in […] We're extremely good at picking up on signals. What we can then do is trigger the appropriate response. If it's an empathetic response we may well need to then be sympathetic, we maybe need to show our sort of fluffy side if you want. But on the flipside from an evolutionary point of view the reason we are so successful and we're still here is because we can, and when we need to, react aggressively to situations.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nDid you spot the phrase?\n<strong>Flipside</strong>\nmeans the opposite side to an idea. And being aggressive is the flipside of being fluffy and sympathetic.\n<strong>Catherine</strong>\n<br/>\nFluffy, by the way, is an adjective we often use to describe soft animal fur or feathers on young animals or soft toys for children. But here\n<strong>fluffy</strong>\nmeans behaviour that is soft and unthreatening so it’s the opposite of aggressive.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd if you are\n<strong>empathetic</strong>\nyou are able to share or understand another person's feelings. That sounds like me! I'm an excellent empathizer, aren't I, Catherine?\n<strong>Catherine</strong>\n<br/>\nNeil, you are absolutely totally full of … empathy.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nNice pause.\n<strong>Catherine</strong>\n<br/>\nThank you.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nNow, Simon also talks about humans being good at\n<strong>reading situations</strong>\n. What does that mean, Catherine?\n<strong>Catherine</strong>\n<br/>\nIt means understanding what's going on. For example, if a male gorilla is screaming and breaking branches, other gorillas will probably see this as a show of aggression.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nThe male gorilla screams and breaks branches, signalling to the other gorillas that he's angry or upset.\n<strong>Signal</strong>\nhere means a noise or a movement that gives someone information.\n<strong>Catherine</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd the male gorilla's signal\n<strong>triggers a response</strong>\nfrom the other gorillas. This means one thing causes another thing to happen.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd when a man suddenly punches another man in the face, what signal does that send?\n<strong>Catherine</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, I think for me that would be a signal to leave!\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nYes. Quickly.\n<strong>Catherine</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, indeed. And humans usually give signals just like the gorillas do, before they start a fight. So people might shout, or gesture with their arms. And a\n<strong>gesture</strong>\nis a movement made with arms or head to give someone else information. Now then, Neil. Let's have our quiz question answer please.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nOK, OK, stop waving your arms around. So I asked: When attacked, what does a baboon typically do to show aggression? Does it…a) beat its chest? b) yawn and show its teeth? or c) laugh and roll on the ground?\n<strong>Catherine</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd I said b).\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nThat’s right. Well done! Now let's hear today's words once again.\n<strong>Catherine</strong>\n<br/>\nThey are:\nout of the blue\n<br/>\naggressive\n<br/>\nsulk\n<br/>\nwell balanced\n<br/>\ngrounded\n<br/>\nflipside\n<br/>\nfluffy\n<br/>\nempathetic\n<br/>\nreading situations\n<br/>\nsignal\n<br/>\ntriggers a response\n<br/>\ngesture\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Rob…</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>… and I'm Neil. Hello.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hi there, Neil! Now, Neil... what's that on your face? </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What… this? It's a beard, Rob. Have you never seen one before?</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I have. But I've never seen one on you before… and I'm surprised to say, it looks good on you!  </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, thank you! I thought I'd get on the beard bandwagon, you know. Beards are <strong>all the rage</strong> at the moment - that means 'very fashionable'. </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And <strong>to get on a bandwagon</strong> is when you join other people in doing something that has become popular – perhaps because you hope to become popular yourself! </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that doesn't apply to me, Rob, because, as you know, I'm very popular already.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. Yes, I know that, of course... Anyway, beards are such <strong>a talking point</strong> – a subject that a lot of people are discussing – that we decided to talk about them on today's programme! So are you ready for today's question, Neil? What's the name for someone who loves beards? Is it…</span>\n<span>a) barbophile?</span>\n<span>b) pogonophile?</span>\n<span>or c) pelophile?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hmm. All the answers sound tempting. But I’m going to go for a) barbophile.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Right. OK, well we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. But this is interesting: a new scientific study suggests that the more beards there are in a population, the less attractive they become – and this currently gives clean-shaven men a competitive advantage. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span>\n<span>Oh, no! That's bad news for me, then! <strong>Competitive advantage</strong> means when a condition or circumstance puts you in a favourable position – in this case, being <strong>clean-shaven</strong> or having no facial hair. </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's right. We’ve reached 'peak beard' apparently. Beard popularity has <strong>peaked</strong> – or reached its highest point – and will decline in popularity from this point. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK. Let's listen to writer, Lucinda Hawksley, talking about beards through history. And listen out for a word that means women's struggle to achieve the same rights and opportunities as men.</span>\n<strong><span>Lucinda Hawksley, writer of Moustaches, Whiskers and Beards<br/></span></strong>\n<span>It's interesting, while I was writing the book I came to realize that the most heavily bearded times in Britain are either when women are in power, such as Elizabeth I or Queen Victoria, or when there's a big discussion of feminism - and it is really interesting that in the last few years there's been so much more discussion of feminism. You get a woman on the throne and men go, 'Oh, got to have a beard.' It's really strange. Or in the 60s or 70s with all the kind of, you know, big thing about women's lib, suddenly the beard becomes huge here.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span>\n<span>Well, needless to say Lucinda doesn't have a beard, but she certainly knows a lot about them. She's the great great granddaughter of famous writer Charles Dickens, who <strong>sported</strong> – or wore – a very flamboyant beard. <strong>Flamboyant</strong> means eye-catching and different. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, did you spot the word for women's struggle to achieve the same rights as men? </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. It's <strong>feminism</strong>. She also talks about <strong>women's lib</strong>, which is short for women's liberation. And this has a similar meaning to feminism. So, what do you think, Neil? Are beards a show of testosterone in reaction to powerful women? Is that why you've grown your beard?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I don't think it's <strong>testosterone</strong> – that's the main male hormone. For me, it's laziness. I'm flying the flag for men's lib – liberation from the razor.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Right. Well, I'm not sure whether that's a worthy cause or not, Neil. Let's hear from Brock Elbank, the photographer behind the exhibition 'Beard'. He’s talking about one of the people he photographed.</span>\n<span><strong>Brock Elbank, photographer<br/></strong>I found Jimmy on a friend's Facebook page whilst I was in Sydney. Invited him to come to my home studio for a portrait and I posted it and it got reblogged over half a million times in four hours. I mean I think when Jimmy and I… when I met Jimmy he told me about his 'beard season' melanoma charity and I was kind of on board from the get go.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So Jimmy must have a pretty awesome beard!  </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Indeed. We should check out the Beard exhibition and find out. But Jimmy has a beard for a special reason, right Neil?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's right. Yes. Brock mentions Jimmy's melanoma charity. <strong>Melanoma</strong> is a serious type of skin cancer and Jimmy is raising money and awareness to help people who suffer from it.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And Brock says he was <strong>on</strong> <strong>board from the get go</strong> – meaning he wanted to be involved with the charity right from the start.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We should also mention 'Movember' and 'Decembeard' – both campaigns invite men to get hairy for good causes.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's right, good causes – moustaches in November and beards in December. Now, let's have the answer to the quiz question. I asked: what's the name for someone who loves beards. Was it: a) barbophile b) pogonopile or c) pelophile? </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said a) barbophile. </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Wrong, I'm afraid. The answer is actually b) pogonophile.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Oh, well, you can't win them all. Now then, Rob, can we hear today's words again?</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Sure. We heard:</span>\n<span>all the rage<br/></span>\n<span>get on a bandwagon<br/></span>\n<span>talking point<br/></span>\n<span>competitive advantage<br/></span>\n<span>clean shaven<br/></span>\n<span>peaked<br/></span>\n<span>sport<br/></span>\n<span>flamboyant<br/></span>\n<span>feminism<br/>women's lib<br/>testosterone<br/>melanoma<br/></span>\n<span>on board from the get go</span>\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\n<span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. We hope it wasn't too hair-raising for you. Please join us again soon.</span>\n<span><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye.</span>"

Where is this new flat? </span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's in the city. It's a one-bed flat so it's <strong>bijoux</strong> - meaning small but attractive. There's a balcony, I've got a couple of deckchairs, and a barbecue...</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I can't wait to see it. It sounds perfect. Well, today we're discussing housing - and why in some buildings there are separate entrances for rich and poor residents! So, are you ready for today's quiz question, Neil?</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm all ears.</span>\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">OK, so you mean you're listening carefully.</span>\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">I am.</span>\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Right. What does 'social housing' mean? Is it housing for people who...</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">a) want to buy or rent at a low price?</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">b) want to live together sharing facilities?</span>\nor c) aren't able to pay any rent at all?\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">OK, I think the answer is a) to buy or rent at a low price.</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. Well, we'll see if you were right or wrong later on in the programme. So, have you met your neighbours yet, Neil?</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes - I bumped into one couple as I was leaving for work this morning.</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I see.<strong> Bump into</strong> means to meet somebody by chance. So were they friendly?</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, they complained about me blocking the communal area with my bike - also about my guitar playing. But apart from that, they seemed nice!</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Rob<br/></strong>A <strong>communal area</strong> is an area that is shared by a number of people. Well, I hate to say it, Neil, but your guitar playing is annoying!</span>\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nOh, Rob, genius isn't appreciated here, I think. OK... Let's listen to the journalist Tom Bateman talking about rich and poor doors.\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Tom Bateman, journalist<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">In front of us here is a 20-storey building. Right about me I got tinted blue glass windows and balconies on every floor as you look from the street. And there is a very plush foyer. A sign in the window says 'luxurious penthouses with spectacular views.'</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But this is what the journalist Tom Bateman saw when he went around the other side of the same building.</span>\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Tom Bateman, journalist<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">So as you come down the side of the building, you can see the windows - quite small windows - of the flats above here - certainly no balconies. This is a big grey concrete wall and as you walk down an alleyway towards the other door.</span>\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nSo this building has one entrance with a\n<strong>plush</strong>\n- or expensive and luxurious - foyer. And\n<strong>foyer</strong>\nmeans entrance hall. Then there's another entrance down an\n<strong>alleyway</strong>\n- or narrow passage between buildings.\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">This entrance leads to flats with small windows and no balconies. Why's that, Rob? </span>\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThat's because the alleyway entrance is the so-called 'poor door'. There' no swanky foyer or tinted glass windows for these residents because they pay less rent than the people living in the apartments at the front.\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Swanky</strong> means something fashionable and expensive that is designed to impress people. And <strong>tinted</strong> glass is coloured glass - so people can't look through your windows.</span>\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">That sounds useful! Do you have tinted glass windows, Neil?</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">No, I don't. Tinted sunglasses are all that I can afford. So what do people think about having a rich door and a poor door for the same building, Rob? </span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Well, some people think it's terrible. They say it's <strong>segregation</strong> - or separation and different treatment of people - and I can't believe the poor-door people put up with it really!</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>To</strong> <strong>put up with something</strong> means to accept something that is annoying without complaining about it. The thing is, though, the poor-door people don't pay nearly as much rent. And they don't have to pay the same service charges that the rich-door people pay.</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">A <strong>service charge </strong>is an amount of money you pay to the owner of an apartment building for things like putting out the rubbish. Well, let's listen to an experience of a poor-door resident. </span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Abdul Mohammed, resident of One Commercial St, City of London<br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">We can't use the lift... because it's for the rich people. So whenever the doors open, I use it. So they try and tell me off for using it. I say, 'here, come, take me to court - I don't mind'. </span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">So what has Abdul been doing that the rich-door residents don't like, Rob?</span>\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, he's been using their lift because it's near his apartment door.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd what does Abdul mean when he says, 'come, take me to court'?\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">He's inviting the rich-door residents to take legal action against him, but Abdul doesn't really think he's doing anything wrong. </span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, it's time to hear the answer to today's quiz question.</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. What does 'social housing' mean? Is it flats or houses for people... a) who want to buy or rent at a low price? b) who want to live together sharing facilities? or c) who aren't able to pay any rent at all?</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said a) to buy or rent at a low price.</span>\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd you were right! So well done for that, Neil. Now, shall we listen to the words we've learned on today's programme?\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Good idea. We heard:<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">bijoux<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">bump into<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">communal area<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">plush<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">foyer<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">alleyway<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">swanky<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">tinted<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">segregation<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">to put up with something<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">service charge</span>\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Thank you. Well, that's the end of today'</span>\ns 6 Minute English. I hope you felt at home with us on today's show!

I'm Rob…\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\n… and I'm Neil. Hello.\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nHello, Neil! I watched that space movie last night – the one where those astronauts are stranded in space.\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\n<strong>Stranded</strong>\nmeans stuck in a place with only a small chance of leaving.\n<em>Gravity</em>\n, you mean?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThat's the one. And this year marks the 50th anniversary of the first ever space walk. On 18th March 1965 Russian cosmonaut Alexei Leonov was the first man to drift free in space – 500km from the surface of Earth. And that’s the subject of today’s show!\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nWhat on earth must that have felt like?\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nAh ha! Exactly. It would have felt\n<strong>like</strong>\n<strong>nothing on earth</strong>\n– and that’s to say, very strange indeed. He was the first person to experience the colourful geography of our planet stretched out before him.\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nVery poetic, Rob! But moving on, how about answering today’s quiz question: How long did the first space walk last? Was it...\na) 2 minutes?\nb) 12 minutes?\nor c) 22 minutes?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nHmm. All quite short – so I think I’ll go for the one in the middle – 12 minutes.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWe'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. Now, ‘cosmonaut’ literally means ‘sailor of the universe’. But Leonov’s mission wasn’t\n<strong>plain sailing</strong>\n– in other words, it wasn’t easy or straightforward.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThat’s right.  No one had ever gone out into space before – it was unknown territory –\n<strong>unknown territory</strong>\nmeans a place or activity that people do not know anything about or have not experienced before. And as it happens, there were big problems.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWhen Leonov left the capsule his spacesuit\n<strong>inflated</strong>\n– or swelled up – like a balloon because the pressure inside the suit was greater than outside.  This made it impossible for Leonov to get back through the door of the spacecraft, putting him in a life-threatening situation.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nLet’s listen to Helen Sharman, the first Briton in space, talking about it.\n<strong>Helen Sharman, first Briton in space<br/></strong>\nSo he decreases the pressure of his suit, which means that it’s a bit more able to move inside it, but it means the amount of oxygen he’s got around his face is now dangerously low so he can’t cope with that for very long. So if he’s not able to get in quickly, he’s going to die of oxygen starvation, um […] so he had the presence of mind to get on with all of this, got back in, swivelled himself round, managed to close the airlock, and then when the pressure was equilibrated was finally able to, you know, hug his compatriot up there in space.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nNow, if you\n<strong>can’t cope</strong>\n<strong>with</strong>\n<strong>something</strong>\nit means you are unable to deal successfully with a difficult situation. And here the situation was having very little oxygen.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nBut Leonov had the presence of mind to find a solution.\n<strong>Presence of mind</strong>\nmeans being able to react quickly and stay calm in a difficult or dangerous situation.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd if I was\n<strong>in Leonov’s shoes</strong>\n– meaning if I was in his situation – I would have panicked big time!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd there was plenty more to panic about before the mission was over. The spacecraft’s automatic re-entry system failed so the cosmonauts had to fire the rockets\n<strong>manually</strong>\n– meaning controlled by hand – which they had never done before.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd that’s not all. Their capsule failed to\n<strong>detach</strong>\n– or separate – from the spacecraft’s equipment module, and this sent them tumbling through space towards Earth.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nBut the capsule did finally detach. And then you would think they’d have been home and dry, wouldn’t you?\n<strong>Home and dry</strong>\nmeans being close to achieving a goal.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, they certainly weren’t dry. The capsule\n<strong>touched down</strong>\n– or landed – hundreds of kilometres off course in freezing Siberia populated only by wolves and bears. Leonov had sweated so much on the space walk that his boots were filled with water up to his knees! Both cosmonauts had to\n<strong>wring out</strong>\n– or twist and squeeze – their clothes to avoid frostbite.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd\n<strong>off course</strong>\n, by the way, means not following the right route. Those men must have been overjoyed when they were finally airlifted to safety two days later!\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nBut what seems unfair to me is, we all know about the Apollo moon landing, but how many of us know about the first space walk?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, at least we do now, and of course our listeners do too!\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nOK, let’s have the answer to the quiz question. I asked: How long did the first space walk last? Was it… a) 2 minutes b) 12 minutes or c) 22 minutes?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nI said a) 12 minutes.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd you were right!\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nExcellent. Good! So 12 minutes eh? What an amazing short stroll that must have been but a very historic one too.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell done. Now, can we hear today’s words again please?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK. We heard:\nstranded\nlike nothing on earth\nplain sailing\nunknown territory\ninflated\ncan’t cope with something\npresence of mind\nin Leonov’s shoes\nmanually\ndetach\nhome and dry\ntouched down\nwring out\noff course\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, that’s the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Rob...\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\n...and I'm Neil. Hello.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nHello, Neil! Now, Neil, could I borrow your phone charger? My phone's just died.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nEr... I don't think my charger is compatible with your phone.\n<strong>Compatible</strong>\nmeans when you can use things together… I'm afraid there'll be no status updates for you today then Rob.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOh dear. I can't believe it's run out of power already.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, you shouldn’t have bought a state-of-the-art phone – it's a big drain on the battery.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\n<strong>State of the art</strong>\nmeans something that has the newest ideas and features, like my phone. So I should have stuck with a dinosaur like yours, eh, Neil?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd\n<strong> dinosaur</strong>\nhere means something that is out-dated. You can laugh at my phone, but it's got plenty of battery life left – unlike yours!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nHmmm... OK, well, I might just pop out and ask if someone's got the same charger…\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nStay where you are. We're recording a programme! And today's show is… you guessed it… all about phones!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThat's right, Neil. And we're also talking about\n<strong>wireless furniture</strong>\n…\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nPardon?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes, furniture with built-in wireless charging technology - like a coffee table.\n<strong>Built in</strong>\nmeans the technology is included as part of the table. So you just pop your phone on the table, and technology does the rest!\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nMagic! And\n<strong>wireless technology</strong>\nis the way mobile phones work using radio waves to send and receive data. So that's what we need - a desk with a built-in charging spot for both our phones! But would it be compatible for both of them?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, that's an excellent question - and I don't have the answer. But can you tell me the answer to this: What do modern phone batteries contain? Is it...\na) nickel\nb) lithium\nor c) lead-acid\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, lead-acid sounds dangerous... so I think it's either nickel or lithium. I'll go with lithium.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK, well, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. But now let's listen to journalist Daisy Buchanan who thinks that mobile phones have stopped us having conversations. And listen out for a phrase that means 'it's unlikely to happen soon'.\n<strong>INSERT<br/></strong>\n<strong>Daisy Buchanan, writer for the Telegraph &amp; the Guardian newspapers<br/></strong>\nI was thinking yesterday how it used to be, you know, you used to sort of go into a café or a pub maybe and look for where the loos are but now the first thing we're looking for is sockets to try and find where you can charge if you... you know, if you're having an emergency... And maybe with this, I might be being naïve - I suspect I am - especially with Ikea's new wireless charging furniture... that maybe if our batteries died a bit more frequently we are going to... you know... look up a bit more and have a few more conversations. I'm not holding my breath, but you can but hope.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nDaisy said some really interesting things there, so let's listen to that clip again.\n<strong><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Daisy Buchanan, writer for the Telegraph &amp; the Guardian newspapers<br/></strong></strong>\nI was thinking yesterday how it used to be, you know, you used to sort of go into a café or a pub maybe and look for where the loos are but now the first thing we're looking for is sockets to try and find where you can charge if you... you know, if you're having an emergency...

I'm not holding my breath, but you can but hope.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nDid you get it? Another way of saying 'It's unlikely to happen soon' is\n<strong>I'm not holding my breath</strong>\n. Now, Daisy doesn't seem keen on the idea of wireless charging furniture. She thinks our phones are stopping us from having conversations.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nIt sounds ridiculous, but it's true, isn't it? We spend far too much time staring at our phones instead of talking to each other.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nSorry. What's that, Neil? I was just looking at my phone.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nCome on, Rob! Put the phone away.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK. Well, that's because phone\n<strong>functionality</strong>\n- that's what a phone can do - is increasing all the time. But let's move on now and\n<strong>think green</strong>\nfor a minute. Are there any environmental factors to consider in relation to new mobile phone technology?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nLet's listen to Fevzi Turkalp talking about the latest model of one mobile phone brand - and find out.\n<strong>INSERT<br/></strong>\n<strong>Fevzi Turkalp, editor of tech advice website GadgetDetective.com<br/></strong>\nThey've taken the decision to make it a sealed unit so no user-replaceable battery... And I guess... you're more likely then to say you know what I won't replace the battery I'll just get a new phone.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nSo Fevzi says this new phone doesn't have a\n<strong>user-replaceable</strong>\nbattery, meaning you can't take it out and replace it - and this is a problem for the environment.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nThat's right - environmentalists want products that are designed to be taken apart. Then they can be easily upgraded, repaired or recycled. But you can't do this with a\n<strong>sealed unit</strong>\n- a unit that cannot be opened.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd this means\n<strong>toxic</strong>\n- or poisonous - materials are often dumped in landfill. And you guessed it – that's really bad for the environment. Now, remember at the beginning of the programme I asked you: What do modern phone batteries contain?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd I said lithium...\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd you know your batteries well because that's the right answer!\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWow. What a great guess! Now Rob, how about those words again?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK, the words we heard today were:\ncompatible\nstate of the art\ndinosaur\nwireless furniture\nbuilt in\nwireless technology\nI'm not holding my breath\nfunctionality\nthink green\nuser-replaceable\nsealed unit\ntoxic\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English. We hope you're feeling charged up by today's programme. Please join us again soon.\n<strong>Both<br/></strong>\nBye."

Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me today is Neil. Hello, Neil.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nHello Rob!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nIn this programme we're going to be talking about endangered species, particularly elephants in China. So let's start with a question, Neil. Do you know how many elephants are still living in the wild in China? Is it:\na)    Fewer than 15,000\nb)    Fewer than 1,000\nc)    Fewer than 300\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nI don't know but I'm going to have a guess and say b) fewer than 1,000.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nI'll let you know if you're right or wrong at the end of the programme.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nSo Rob, have you ever come across any animal species under threat?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes, I have, I went to Australia a few years ago and saw some turtles on the beach laying their eggs and they're very rare, aren't they?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nThey are very rare. I've always wanted to see them but I haven't had the chance.  I was lucky enough to see a panda when I was in China once and they're threatened with extinction, too, of course.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThe sad thing is, Neil, these animals are in danger largely because of the activities of human beings. There are all sorts of reasons why this is happening.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nYes, it's really upsetting. And it could easily be prevented if people thought a bit harder about the impact their lives make on wild animals. Take those sea turtles you were talking about, for instance. They're under threat for all sorts of reasons, over-fishing being one of them.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThen there are various species of rhinoceros which could disappear in a few years' time. Again, people\n<strong>poach</strong>\nthese creatures – poach means hunt illegally - because their horns are used for medicinal purposes. And, of course, in country areas, miles from civilisation, it's almost impossible to keep a check on illegal killings.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nIt really makes you think, doesn't it Rob?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nActually, it's not that simple, Neil. Human beings are also under pressure and often have strong arguments in favour of their actions. This Chinese farmer explains. He uses an expression that means \"arrived\". Can you tell me what it is?\n<strong>Chinese farmer <br/></strong>\nThere are too many elephants around here. We used to grow sugar cane but then the elephants started showing up and ate it all. So we gave up growing it. There was barely anything we could grow. No matter what we planted there was nothing to harvest …. Now we grow rubber. It's the only thing they won't eat.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nHe said \"showing up\". This means the elephants arrived.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd he said they \"gave up\" growing it. This means they stopped growing it.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nThe plight of the Asian elephant in China makes a pretty bleak picture, I must say. I understand that they are victims of all sorts of abuse.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes, experts say their numbers have declined by 50 per cent in the last 75 years. Poaching is one reason why. They are hunted not for their tusks – that happens to the larger African elephant – but for their skins to make leather goods and for their meat.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nThey are also losing their\n<strong>habitats</strong>\n– that's the places where they live - because of the growth in the number of plantations, particularly rubber, but also other cash crops. These agricultural monocultures, as they are called, spell death for the elephants' lifestyle. Logging or deforestation – in which whole forests are destroyed - also adds to their problems.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWhat's more, in some places, their migratory routes have been cut off by human populations living in newly established villages. In a more general sense, just expanding human population is forcing them out of their natural environments.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nThere's another very unpleasant way in which these creatures are suffering, Rob. Many of the young elephants are taken away from the herd and are turned into performing circus animals for tourists.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nReally, Neil?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nYes, I hear that sometimes nails are driven into their feet, they are deprived of sleep, food and water. This is to make them easy to train.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThat's so cruel.  But there are people trying to improve the situation, Neil. For example, there's a\n<strong>rehabilitation programme</strong>\n– that's a scheme to bring them back to a normal life - which rescues elephants at risk and give them protection within a special sanctuary. Then there are some people who are trying to get people to get farmers to work in a different way. Let's listen to a forestry policeman. He uses an expression to describe the way people farm the land. Can you tell me what it is?\n<strong>Forestry police representative</strong>\n<br/>\nIt makes me sad. I want people to know that they shouldn't cut down the forest and that there are consequences if they do. I want them to change their farming practices, to change how they make a living. We could become a tourist destination. People could make money from that.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nHe said \"farming practices\". This means the way people farm the land.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd he said \"make a living\". This refers to people earning enough money in order to survive. So, let's hope the elephants still living in the wild in China can be saved. So, would you like the answer to the quiz question now?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nYes, OK. You asked me how many elephants are still living in the wild in China. Was it fewer than 15,000, fewer than 1,000, or fewer than 300? And I guessed 1,000.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nI'm afraid the answer is actually fewer than 300.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nThat's a real cause for concern.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, we're almost out of time. So, let's remind ourselves of some of the words we've said today, Neil.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\npoach\nhabitats\nshowing up\ngave up\nfarming practices\nmake a living\nrehabilitation programme\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, that's it for today. Until next time. Goodbye!\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nGoodbye!"

    "description": "Coffee is now the most popular drink in the world – even for the English, long-known as a nation of tea drinkers. And we are becoming more choosy about the coffee we drink - the focus is very much on quality. But what about the economics and politics of coffee production? It's as complicated as getting the right flavour in your cup.\n<strong>This week's question:<br/></strong>\n<br/>\nHow many cups of coffee are drunk worldwide each year?

Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me today is Neil. Hello, Neil.\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nHello Rob!\n<strong> Rob<br/> </strong>\nIn this programme we're going to be talking about coffee.\n<strong> Neil<br/> </strong>\nCoffee? I've actually got one here in front of me, Rob.\n<strong> Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nWhat kind of coffee are you drinking?\n<strong> Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nIt's a skinny latte. And what's that that you've got?\n<strong> Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nI've gone for a flat white today. (Sound of sipping) Mmm. That tastes good.\n<strong> Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nLooks good too! The market for the world's most popular drink has come a long way since the days of instant coffee, when we just added boiling water to some brown powder.\n<strong> Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, that's very true, Neil. After that came the giants like Starbucks and Costa Coffee who made coffee drinking trendy and a lifestyle statement. People are far more aware of what they're drinking these days.\n<strong> Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nBut Rob, I don't think we should forget what lies behind the coffee we enjoy every day. It's a hugely complicated business.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, it's the second biggest commodity in the world, after oil. That means the price of coffee is changing every day, every hour even, as traders speculate about the price.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nIt means farmers in countries like Ethiopia, Costa Rica and Brazil are dependent on the deals that are made in commodity markets thousands of miles from their farms. It makes them extremely vulnerable.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nLet's listen to food journalist Sheila Dillon as she explains the impact of coffee markets on local growers. She uses an expression that means \"has a big effect\". Can you tell me what it is?\n<strong>INSERT<br/></strong>\n<strong>Sheila Dillon, Food Journalist<br/></strong>\nWhat happens in the coffee markets\n<strong>makes waves</strong>\naround the globe. Entire national economies depend on the price of coffee. It's the key to whether individual farmers can\n<strong>provide for</strong>\ntheir families, face unemployment and ultimately whether whole communities stay on the land or trek to the cities.\n<strong> Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nShe said \"makes waves\". This means \"have a big effect\".\n<strong> Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nShe also used the expression \"provide for\" their families. This means the farmer's family have enough income to live comfortably. Good. Right. So what about our quiz question today? Neil do you know many cups of coffee are drunk worldwide each year? Is it:\na)           38 billion\nb)          400 billion\nc)           950 billion\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, it's going to be a huge number, of course. But I still think I'll go for the lowest figure, which is 38 billion.\n<strong> Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, we'll see if you got the right answer at the end of the programme.\n<strong> Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nNow, the price of coffee has soared – that means gone up quickly – in recent years, Rob. Surely that's good for everyone involved in the business? I believe the profit margins for coffee are among the highest in the world. I can't see what all the fuss is about.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, Neil, just because the price is high, it doesn't mean that everyone benefits. It all depends on how the profits are distributed. You see there are countless transactions between the grower and the drinker. A grower can have a really good crop, but the amount he makes stays the same – or can even fall.\n<strong> Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nMmm, I see the problem. I expect most of the profits go to the commodity traders and very little to the individual growers of the bean. It sounds like the growers have no control. That's what happens in other agricultural sectors.\n<strong> Rob<br/> </strong>\nI'm afraid so. Of course, some people are trying to distribute the profits more widely and they have been having some success.\n<strong> Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, I heard about some small-scale projects where the company takes charge of the whole process from field to shop.\n<strong> Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, these organisations tend to farm organically. This is very\n<strong>labour intensive</strong>\n– that means a lot of people are employed – and it creates a lot of jobs for people within the local community. In this way they are not victims of market fluctuations. Let's listen to Leo Virmani, who runs a small plantation like this in Costa Rica. What's the verb he uses for putting the coffee in a box before selling it?\n<strong>INSERT<br/></strong>\n<strong>Leo Virmani, Coffee producer<br/></strong>\nFor our plantation, the approach we have is to go through every step of the way - every step of the process - so that we grow it, we pick it, and we process it in the mill. Then eventually we'll roast it, we'll\n<strong>package</strong>\nit, and we'll sell it as the small plantation we are. And that would allow us to stay or be\n<strong>profitable</strong>\nat the end of the day.\n<strong>Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nSo, he used the verb \"package\", which means \"put a product in a packet or box before selling\" it.\n<strong> Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nAnd he said his community can stay \"profitable\" – this means they can always maintain profits – or make money.\n<strong> Neil<br/> </strong>\nWell, it's good to know that small growers can live reasonably comfortably despite what the world markets are doing. The next time I grab a takeaway coffee I'll try to remember all the politics involved in the production process.\n<strong> Rob<br/> </strong>\nYes, me too. So, shall we have the answer to the quiz question now?\n<strong> Neil</strong>\n<br/>\nYes. You asked me how many cups of coffee are drunk worldwide each year – 38 billion, 400 billion or 950 billion. And I guessed 38 billion.\n<strong> Rob<br/> </strong>\nI'm afraid you're wrong – the answer is actually 400 billion.\n<strong> Neil<br/> </strong>\nNo way.That's incredible.\n<strong> Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nYes, it's an extraordinary statistic. Well, we're almost out of time. So, let's remind ourselves of some of the words we've said today, Neil.\n<strong> Neil<br/></strong>\ncommodity\nspeculate\nfluctuations\nvulnerable\nmake waves\nprovides for\nlabour intensive\npackage\nprofitable\n<strong>Rob</strong>\n<br/>\nWell, that's it for today.

I'm Rob…</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>… and I'm Neil. Hello.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hello, Neil, and what a glorious sunny day it is today. Not a cloud in the sky! Spring is definitely here! Now, Neil, you’re a bit of a sun worshipper, aren’t you? You like sunbathing…</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I do indeed! I love sitting in my deckchair in the garden, catching some rays…</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hmm, yes, you look a bit orange actually. Are you sure that tan's not fake? </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span>\n<span>Very cheeky, Rob, very cheeky…</span>\n<strong><span>Rob</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>Now the reason I mentioned sunbathing is because we’re discussing the sun in this programme.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, that’s right. The sun is our nearest star – although it’s a staggering 150 million kilometres away. Earth is one of nine planets that <strong>orbit</strong> – or circle around – the sun. And life on Earth couldn’t exist without its warmth and light.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And we should mention… the sun is absolutely <strong>massive</strong>. Its volume is so large you could fit a million Earths inside it.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That’s amazing! It’s also incredibly hot. Hotter than anything you could imagine. </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So Neil, can you answer this question: How hot is the surface of the sun? Now I’ll help you out by telling you that the sun’s <strong>core</strong> – that’s the centre – is a blistering five million degrees Celsius. But how hot is the sun’s surface? Is it ...</span>\n<span>a) 1.5 billion degrees Celsius</span>\n<span>b) 1.5 million degrees Celsius</span>\n<span>or c) 5500 degrees Celsius</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hmm. I have no idea. They all sound quite warm to me. But … I think it must be a bit cooler than the core. So I’m going to go for 1.5 million degrees.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Okay. Well, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. But now let’s listen to Professor of Solar Physics Louise Harra to discover what the sun is made of.</span>\n<strong><span>Louise Harra, Professor of Solar Physics at UCL Mullard Space Science<br/></span></strong>\n<span>It’s just a big ball of gas. And we measure it… it’s made mostly of hydrogen. So it’s roughly 90% hydrogen, it’s maybe 8% helium, and the rest of it’s made up of things like iron, carbon, oxygen, nickel.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So the main gas is hydrogen, which accounts for 90% of the sun’s <strong>matter</strong>. Now, 'matter' means what something is made of.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And hydrogen creates all the sun’s <strong>energy</strong>. Heat and light energy is created all the time in the sun’s core as a result of gas explosions or nuclear reactions. And this bit is hard to believe – it takes a hundred thousand years for this light energy to travel from the sun’s core to the sun’s surface. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But once it reaches the sun’s surface – the <strong>photosphere</strong> – it can escape. In fact, it takes only eight minutes for light energy from the sun to reach the Earth. Scientists these days are able to see the photosphere in fantastic detail using powerful telescopes.  </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Though Galileo observed dark spots on the sun through his telescope several hundred years ago, didn’t he? Which brings us on to another question: How old is the sun? </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I happen to know that it came into being around four and a half billion years ago. </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Did you study solar physics at university, Neil? </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>No, just… you know, just general knowledge.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, the sun <strong>came into being</strong> – or was created – a very long time ago! We’re going to hear now from Professor of Physics, Yvonne Elseworth. What does she say about how long the sun is going to stay the same?</span>\n<span><strong>Yvonne Elseworth, Poynting Professor of Physics at the University of Birmingham<br/></strong>In terms of its current lifestyle it’s here for as long again, so we’re about half way through. And then it becomes a different sort of star – it becomes a giant star and that’s probably curtains for us, actually. It’ll get a bit warm, a bit toasty, and we’ll get enveloped in the sun, and it won’t be nice...</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So the sun is going to stay the same for another four and a half billion years. But the professor also says that the sun will change. When it becomes a giant star, it will be <strong>curtains</strong> for our planet – and ‘curtains’ means the end, I’m afraid!</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, it does. And as a giant star, the sun will get hotter – it will make the Earth <strong>toasty</strong>. Now, toasty usually means hot in a nice way.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That’s right – for example, my toes are warm and toasty in my new slippers. But in reality the giant sun will make the Earth unbearably hot. It will surround – or <strong>envelop</strong> – our planet and burn it up.  </span>\n<strong><span>Rob</span></strong>\n<br/>\n<span>Well, I’m glad we’re not going to be around when that happens. Now, remember at the beginning of the show I asked you how hot the sun’s surface is? Is it a) 1.5 billion b) 1.5 million or c) 5500 degrees Celsius?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said 1.5 million…</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It’s way too hot, I’m afraid you were wrong. The answer is actually 5500 degrees Celsius. But still, if you’re planning on visiting the sun, remember to take your sunglasses and plenty of sunscreen! Now, before we go, it’s time to remind ourselves of some of the vocabulary that we’ve heard today. Neil.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>orbit</span>\n<span>massive</span>\n<span>core</span>\n<span>energy</span>\n<span>matter</span>\n<span>photosphere</span>\n<span>come into being</span>\n<span>curtains for something</span>\n<span>toasty</span>\n<span>envelop</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Thanks.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil and with me in the studio today is Harry. </span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Hello!</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We all have two biological parents but in the future if someone from the UK tells you they have three parents, it might be true. </span>\n<span><strong>Harry<br/></strong>That's right. This is because the UK has become the first country to approve laws allowing the creation of babies with <strong>DNA</strong> from three people! DNA is the chemical structure present in the centre of a cell which defines somebody's characteristics. This is to fight a particular disease.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. Sometimes parts of the DNA called <strong>genes</strong> are <strong>faulty</strong>; it means they don't work properly and this might cause problems later on. A new technique will allow some of these genes to be replaced by healthy ones from a third person. </span>\n<strong><span>Harry</span></strong>\n<span> <br/>This practice is controversial – people argue about it. They fear we're going to mess with nature and end up with a Frankenstein's monster!</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Wow, that would be frightening, let's hope it doesn't happen! Well, in this programme we're talking about the three-parent baby and you're going to learn some vocabulary related to reproduction.</span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span><strong>Genetics</strong> – the science of how living creatures pass their characteristics to their offspring – is fascinating, Neil! </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>It is fascinating, and you know what I find most surprising, Harry? It's how much DNA we have in common with other living creatures.</span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I've heard that a very high percentage of our DNA is similar to the DNA of monkeys. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>The comparison with monkeys is easy. Over 95% of our DNA is identical to theirs. But what you might not know is… how much of our DNA is similar to the DNA in a banana?</span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>A banana?!</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. And that's my quiz question today. What percentage of our DNA is similar to that of a banana? Is it:</span>\n<span>a)</span>\n<span>About 1%</span>\n<span>b)</span>\n<span>About 20% or</span>\n<span>c)</span>\n<span>About 50%</span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I think we have very little in common with bananas so I'm gonna go for 1%. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, I'll give you the correct answer at the end of the programme. Now let's talk about the three-parent baby. A <strong>pioneering</strong> technique, in other words, a technique never used before, has been developed by scientists in Newcastle University here in the UK. The technique helps people with faulty <strong>mitochondria</strong>, which are structures that work like energy factories in our cells. The mitochondria are like batteries.</span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And what kind of problems do people who inherit faulty mitochondria have?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>They have serious health problems such as brain damage and heart failure. </span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That's terrible! Maybe it would be good to have this technique approved.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, not everybody agrees with it. Fiona Bruce, who is a Member of Parliament here in Britain, expressed concern when the proposal was discussed in Parliament. Listen out for the expression she uses right at the beginning of her speech. It means that when you start something, you can't take it back.</span>\n<span><strong>Fiona Bruce MP<br/></strong>Once <strong>the genie is out of the bottle</strong>, once these procedures that we are being asked to authorise today go ahead, there will be no going back for society. </span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>She says that <strong>the genie is out of the bottle</strong>. It's an expression to do with fairy tales – in particular, the story of Aladdin, when he rubs a lamp and a genie appears. When the genie is released, anything is possible – even bad things. And there's nothing anyone can do to stop it.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So in the case of DNA engineering, people are afraid that similar techniques might be used to create <strong>designer babies</strong> – babies whose characteristics like height, sex, hair and eye colour are created to order. Or we might be looking at babies with several parents - and who knows where it might end.</span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>But the approval of this proposal has also made many people happy,</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, people like Victoria, a mother who has a sick child because of faulty mitochondria. She uses an expression which means 'amazing or astonishing'. Which expression is it?</span>\n<strong><span>Victoria Holliday, mother who will benefit from the new technique<br/></span></strong>\n<span>It's just <strong>mind-boggling</strong> what this could mean for our family and for other families who are affected. It's just the best news!</span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>She uses the expression 'mind-boggling', in other words something astonishing, overwhelming. That's great news for this lady. I'm happy for her.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, it is. According to statistics faulty mitochondria affects one in every 6,500 babies - a considerable number of people. Well, this is an interesting subject but we're running out of time and…</span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>… and you're going to tell me what percentage of DNA we have in common with a banana, aren't you? </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I am. And the options I gave you were about 1%, 20% or 50%. And you said…</span>\n<span><strong>Harry<br/></strong>I said I thought it was just 1%. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, can you believe that it's 50%? We are half… half and half like bananas.</span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That's incredible! They're not even mammals, we are so different to them … It's mind-boggling! </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Let's listen to today's words once again, Harry.</span>\n<span><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Yes. They were:</span>\n<span>DNA</span>\n<span>genes</span>\n<span>faulty</span>\n<span>genetics</span>\n<span>pioneering</span>\n<span>mitochondria (the singular is irregular: mitochondrion)</span>\n<span>the genie is out of the bottle</span>\n<span>designer babies</span>\n<span>mind-boggling</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's it for today.

I'm Neil…\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nAnd I'm Harry.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nNow Harry, have you ever taken a '\n<strong>selfie</strong>\n' – that's a photo of yourself, usually with your mobile phone?\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nYes, I have. I've taken them all over London with my children – of course selfies are very easy to take with your smartphone and recently we've seen some famous selfies featuring well-known people such as the one taken by actor, Ellen DeGeneres at last year's Oscars ceremony.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nYes, it seems that there are no limits to the places where you can\n<strong>capture</strong>\nyourself in a photo. But there is a limit on how far you can stretch your arm out and take\n<strong>a snap</strong>\n– a quick photo – of you and your friends.\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nThat's true, so thank goodness for the\n<strong>selfie stick</strong>\n– an expanding pole to put your smartphone on which gives you a wider view. This means you can take in more of the background. Sounds like a good idea.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nIt does, but it's also causing a problem in some places around the world. More on that in a moment but let's not forget I have a question to ask you Harry.\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nOK Neil.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, we know some people love to take photos of themselves but perhaps not as much as Patrick Peterson. According to Guinness World Records he has taken the most 'selfies' in one hour – but do you know how many? Is it:\na)    449\nb)    1,449\nc)    2,449\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nWell, I guess he's gotta move and be in a different position so I'm not going to go for the highest one. I'm gonna say1,449.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nOK, well, we'll find out the answer at the end of the programme. But now let's talk more about the dangers of the selfie stick! They can certainly be useful for taking photos from a different\n<strong>viewpoint</strong>\nand it does mean that you get more people in your photo.\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nSales of the selfie stick have\n<strong>soared</strong>\n– or risen quickly - since last year and they are now a common sight at tourist destinations. They're great if you want to take a better photo but they're very annoying if you're not involved with the photo.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nYes and this is particularly frustrating if you're trying to look at paintings and sculptures at an art gallery. They just get in the way and can be very\n<strong>distracting</strong>\n.\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nYou mean they stop someone giving their full attention to what they are looking at. Well, this is the reason that some famous art galleries around the world are putting\n<strong>a ban</strong>\non selfie-sticks – a ban means they are no longer allowed.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nPlaces such as the Smithsonian museums in Washington and the Palace of Versailles in Paris were the first to do this and now the National Gallery in London have stopped them being used.\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nLet's hear the exact reasons why from the gallery's Doctor Susan Foister. What phrase does she use to mean trying to do the best thing for the visitors and for the paintings themselves?\n<strong>Doctor Susan Foister, Deputy Director, The National Gallery<br/></strong>\nWe have over 6 million visitors a year here, some of our rooms could get quite crowded, so we have to find the right balance between the experience of our visitors close to the paintings and the safety of the paintings themselves.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nSo the National Gallery is a popular and busy place and it gets quite crowded – and it doesn't help the problem if people are holding up selfie sticks!\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nYes – so they have\n<strong>imposed</strong>\n– or brought in – this ban to do the best thing for the visitors and for the paintings themselves – it's what Doctor Foister called 'the right balance'. She wants to give visitors trying to get close to the paintings a good experience.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd she makes the point that there's a risk that the painting, which can be worth millions of pounds, could be damaged by one of these sticks.\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nOf course you are still allowed to take a selfie, and some museums are\n<strong>'sticking their neck out'</strong>\nand still allowing people to use them.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nA good idiom there Harry – you mean they're doing something that other people may not like – yes, places such as the ICA – that's the Institute for Contemporary Art – in London say selfie sticks are part of modern-day life.\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nHere is Catherine Stout, Head of Programmes at the ICA. How does she describe the type of visitors who go to her gallery?\n<strong>Catherine Stout, Head of Programmes, ICA<br/></strong>\nWe are very happy for our visitors to take their own photographs for personal use, of course we always secure the artist's permission, but actually because we have a very young audience they're completely engaged with social media, they want to use that forum to connect with each other, to share their experiences, if they wish to use a stick they're very welcome to do so as long as, obviously, the artwork is not damaged in any way.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nSo the people who visit that gallery are young and use social media a lot – they are '\n<strong>engaged</strong>\n' with it and they like to share their experiences. This means taking photos on their smartphones and if they want to use a selfie stick?\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\n… then they are 'welcome to do so'. Just watch out where you stick it! I suppose, as long as you respect other visitors and don't get in the way, then it's ok to use one.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell I'm not so sure. Anyway, it's time to reveal the answer to the question I asked you earlier.\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nYes, this was about Patrick Peterson, who holds the record for taking the most selfies in one hour. You asked me if he took 449, 1,449 or 2,449 in one hour.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd you said 1,449, which was … the correct answer! I wonder what he did with all those images…\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nHe probably put them on social media.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell we need to 'stick' to our six minutes of English but just before we run out of time, could you remind us of some of the vocabulary we've used today Harry?\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nYes. We had…\nselfie\ncapture\na snap\nselfie stick\nviewpoint\nsoared\ndistracting\na ban\nimposed\nsticking their neck out\nengaged\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nThank you. Well, that's it for now.

I'm Neil and with me in the studio is Harry. Hello, Harry.\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nHello.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nNow, Harry, do you have many passwords?\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\n<strong>Passwords</strong>\n- you mean the set of words and numbers which I keep secret and allow me to access information? Yes, I do actually. I've got a few for my computer and the different websites I use, and then there are my cards – credit card, debit card. And there's one for my ID here at the BBC and then there is…\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nOK. I get the idea. There are too many, aren't there?\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nOh, yes! Sometimes I struggle to remember them all. And we are advised to learn them\n<strong> by heart</strong>\n, in other words, to have them memorised and not written down.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nIt's for security reasons. If you write them down and lose the paper you wrote them on, then they won't be secret anymore, will they? Now, how would you like to have access to things with no need for passwords or cards?\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nYeah, that would be brilliant!\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nIn this programme, I'm going to tell you about a futuristic commercial building in Stockholm, Sweden, where you don't have to remember any passwords, you don't have to carry ID cards and in some cases, you don't even need to carry money to pay for your coffee.\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nHow does it all work then - by magic?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nNo, by inserting a\n<strong>microchip</strong>\nunder the skin of your hand! A microchip is a very small device with an electronic circuit which can do particular things. In this case, the microchip we're talking about can identify you.\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nWow! I'm not sure I'd want a microchip inserted under my skin.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nNo, me neither. It's interesting though, isn't it? Before I tell you about this experiment, let's go for our quiz question. And, of course, it's about passwords.  Security firm SplashData publishes an annual report about the weakest passwords people use. Well, which was the most common password used in 2014. Was it:\na)    abc123\nb)    the numbers 123456\nc)    the words 'trustno' followed by the number 1\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nI'm going to go for C, 'trustno' followed by the 1, because actually it's the only one I hadn't heard of, even though it's very obvious.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, all will be revealed at the end of the programme. Now we are talking about the increasing need for ID in a society which works more and more with computers - and you'll learn some related vocabulary.\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nTell us more about this building in Sweden, Neil. You have this microchip put under your skin - and what does it allow you to do inside the building?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nLet's listen to the BBC technology reporter Rory Cellan-Jones. He went there for a visit. He uses an expression to say that the technology is not working perfectly yet because it is brand new. What is that expression?\n<strong>Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology reporter<br/></strong>\nThe new offices will soon host a shifting population of 700 entrepreneurs and employees and they'll all be offered the chance to 'get chipped' if they wish. As well as opening doors that will allow them to use the photocopiers and eventually to log on to computers or pay for food in the cafe. The technology is still\n<strong>having</strong>\n<strong>teething problems</strong>\n– I found it quite a struggle to activate the photocopier! And amongst the people working here I found some enthusiasm but also\n<strong>caution</strong>\n.\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nThe expression is 'having teething problems'. When a new project or device doesn't work perfectly we say it 'has teething problems'.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nYes, the microchip allowed Rory to make the photocopier work just by swiping his hand over a console. But it didn't work straight away.\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nAnd he tells us that some of the workers are reacting with\n<strong>caution</strong>\nto the idea of having a microchip put under their skin. 'Caution' means being careful to avoid something dangerous or risky.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nIt might be risky but we might all be using it one day - who knows? The group running this scheme thinks this might be a good thing. Hannes Sjobland from a Swedish bio-hacking group seems to believe that linking biology and electronic devices can make our daily lives better - but he is concerned about people's freedom. And what if a government or a big corporation wants to use this technology in the future? What does Hannes Sjobland want to be able to do if it happens? A tip, the word is a verb…\n<strong>Hannes Sjoband, Swedish bio-hacking group<br/></strong>\nWe are early adopters of this technology, we experiment with it, we learn it, how it works, because I think that there might be a day when the taxman or the big corporates … they will come and say 'hey, try this chip, try this implant', and then we will be able\n<strong>to question</strong>\ntheir proposals.\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nHe wants to question their proposals; it means to express doubts about their proposals and intentions. You know what, Neil? I'd rather have my passwords!\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, talking about passwords, let's go back to my quiz question. I asked you what the weakest passwords people use is, according to the 2014 report by the online security firm SplashData. The options were: abc123, the numbers 123456 and the words 'trustno' followed by the number 1.\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nAnd I said the third one, 'trustno1'.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd you were… wrong I'm afraid Harry. The correct answer is B. The password '123456' has been named as the worst password of 2014. The other two were also in the list. Before we go, can you remind us of the words we heard today, Harry.\n<strong>Harry<br/></strong>\nThe words were:\npassword\nby heart\nmicrochip\nhaving teething problems\ncaution\nto question\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nThank you.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil and with me is Mike. Hello, Mike. </span>\n<span><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span>\n<span>Hello.  </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, today we're talking about someone you might have read about in history books: Winston Churchill – the British Prime Minister during the Second World War who is well-known throughout the world. </span>\n<span><strong>Winston Churchill, British prime minister 1940-1945 and 1951-1955<br/></strong>We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets. We shall fight in the hills. We shall never <strong>surrender</strong>!</span>\n<strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Ah, never surrender, in other words, never submit to your enemy. I remember reading about this speech that Churchill gave in June 1940, when France was being invaded by the forces of Nazi Germany. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, and this shows the spirit of this very famous leader still admired to this day. So much so that here in the UK we are marking the 50th anniversary of Winston Churchill's death.  </span>\n<strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong>\n<span>He was a <strong>controversial</strong> figure wasn't he, Neil? Controversial – it means people have divided opinion about him. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes he was quite a controversial figure. You'll learn more about him in this programme as well as some new words. But first, as ever, I'd like to ask you a quiz question, Mike.</span>\n<span><strong>Mike<br/></strong>OK, I'm ready! </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Do you know a lot about Churchill?</span>\n<span><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span>\n<span>I think I do, yes. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span>\n<span>OK. We'll see about that. Which of these facts about Winston Churchill is false? Now, is it:</span>\n<span>a)</span>\n<span>He won the Nobel Peace Prize.</span>\n<span>b)</span>\n<span>He tried three times before passing exams to the Military Academy.</span>\n<span>c)</span>\n<span>He was a writer and a painter.</span>\n<span><strong>Mike <br/></strong>I think it's (a). I think he won a Nobel Prize but I think it was Literature, not Peace.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span>\n<span>Well, we'll see at the end of the programme. Now, let's talk about Churchill. </span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">You know what, Neil, many people think Churchill has a lot to teach some of today's politicians. He was very <strong>determined</strong>, in other words, he was persistent. When Churchill believed in an idea, he didn't give up easily.   </span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Yes. The Mayor of London Boris Johnson sees another good quality in Britain's wartime leader. He says there's one thing today's politicians do that Churchill didn't. What was it? How did he deal with issues? </span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Boris Johnson, Mayor of London<br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">It's an illusion to think that he was a guy who <strong>skated over</strong> the issues. He was deeply immersed in all the detail and all the technicality and that helped him to get the right answer. </span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Mike<br/></strong>Ah, Churchill didn't 'skate over' the issues. 'To skate over' means to avoid dealing with something. Churchill studied the issues in detail…</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>… and it helped him to get things right, according to Boris Johnson. One example is that Churchill actually went to Germany in the 1930s to assess the situation in the country first hand. </span>\n<span><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span>\n<span>Well, Nazi Germany was defeated and Churchill had a role in that. But there were other things he got wrong. He <strong>misjudged</strong> many situations. Misjudged, in other words, he formed a wrong opinion about them.</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's right! The historian Nigel Knight, a leading academic at Cambridge University, wrote a book about Churchill. He lists some of the mistakes made by the wartime leader throughout his political career. Now, let's listen. How does he describe Churchill's character? </span>\n<span><strong>Dr Nigel Knight, author: \"Churchill: The Greatest Briton Unmasked\"<br/></strong></span>\nChurchill was fundamentally\n<strong>flawed</strong>\n. So was his military\n<strong> strategy</strong>\n: Gallipoli in World War One, which was replicated in the Norwegian, North African and the soft underbelly of Europe campaigns during the World War Two. It was his economic strategy as chancellor in the 1920s, the return to the gold standards, his attitude towards India and the Indians, and indeed his post war 51-55 ministry, which was very\n<strong>lacklustre </strong>\nand very poor indeed.\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Nigel Knight calls Churchill 'flawed', it means he had a weakness in his character. And Churchill didn't get it right all the time. </span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">No. He occupied different posts in government and sometimes he didn't get his strategy, which means his plan of action, right. His strategy in some military campaigns ended up in disaster. </span>\n<span><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span>\n<span>And his strategy regarding the British economy may have actually contributed to a period of economic crisis known as the Great Depression. And when he became prime minister again, in the 50s, his government wasn't very good, was it Neil?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span>\n<span>No. Not according to the Cambridge academic Dr Nigel Knight. He called it 'lacklustre', which means dull, uninspiring. </span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Well, we shall remember him mostly for his speeches in World War Two. </span>\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, we're running out of time so I'll go back to our quiz question.\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Mike<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">You mentioned three facts about Winston Churchill and you said one of them was false, Neil. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, and the options were: <br/></span>\n<span><br/>a)</span>\n<span>He won the Nobel Peace Prize.</span>\n<span>b)</span>\n<span>He tried three times before passing exams to the Military Academy.</span>\n<span>c)</span>\n<span>He was a writer and a painter.</span>\n<span><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span>\n<span>And I said I thought he won the Nobel Literature Prize, not the Peace Prize.</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">And you were absolutely right! Churchill did win a Nobel Prize but it was for Literature because he wrote books about history. He was also a possible candidate for the 1945 Nobel Peace Prize but didn't win. Well, that's it for this programme but let's just remind ourselves of some of the words we've used today. </span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Mike <br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">They were:</span>\n<span>surrender</span>\n<span>controversial</span>\n<span>determined</span>\n<span>skate over</span>\n<span>misjudged</span>\n<span>flawed</span>\n<span>strategy</span>\n<span>lacklustre</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Thanks, Mike.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me today is Harry. Hello, Harry.</span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Hello, Rob!</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, in this programme we're talking about wealth. The world is getting richer, Harry. </span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Really? How come? </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, according to recent data, the number of people living in extreme poverty has halved in recent decades. More people own a car and a mobile phone. </span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So, that's all very good news. More people can have a good <strong>standard of living</strong> – standard of living is what we call the amount of money and quality of life people have in a particular society.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>People in general may have a better life but there's still a lot of inequality in different countries. <strong>Inequality</strong> - in other words some people have a lot of money and opportunities and others just don't.  </span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So, individual governments have to find a way of reducing this inequality, to allow more people to have the opportunity to improve their lives.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. In this programme we're talking about the gap between rich and poor and you'll learn some words which will help you discuss this topic or read about it in the news. And now our quiz, Harry.</span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Ah, the legendary quiz! I'm ready!</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Good. Right. A recent report by Oxfam and Credit Suisse revealed how divided we all are when it comes to wealth. A lot of the wealth in the world is in the hands of very few people. That's what I'm going to ask you about, Harry. How much of the global wealth is owned by the richest 1%? Is it:</span>\n<span>a)</span>\n<span>38%</span>\n<span>b)</span>\n<span>48% or</span>\n<span>c)</span>\n<span>58%</span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, it's only 1% of the population, so I would have to guess the lower one, 38%. Surely they can't own more than that!</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, we'll see if you got the right answer at the end of the programme. Now, let's talk about rich and poor. As we said, experts have concluded that more people are living better when you look at the world as a whole, but in individual countries you can find people with hardly anything to eat…</span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>…and others with lots of houses, cars, land and so on… So, Rob, how can this situation be reversed?</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, David Bryer from Oxfam mentions a country which has achieved some success in trying to make the poor less poor. He is talking about Brazil. Listen to what Bryer says and tell me: what are the two words he uses meaning 'the least money people are paid for the work they do'?</span>\n<strong>David Bryer from Oxfam<br/></strong>\nThere are examples we can look to where countries are managing to reduce the gap between the super-rich and the rest. Brazil has historically very high levels of economic inequality. And they've been taking just some really sensible measures – measures around having more progressive\n<strong>tax</strong>\n, around investing in a higher\n<strong>minimum wage</strong>\n, investing in central public services, you know, these things that all governments can do that start to reverse this tide.\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">So David Bryer talks about a 'minimum wage'. That's the least a worker receives in payment for work they've done. He meant that if people are paid a higher minimum wage, they can eat better, seek a better education, and their children can have a better job in the future. They can be lifted out of poverty.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And the economy can grow. More people with more money buy more things and factories produce more. A factory which produces more will need more workers. So, more jobs for all. </span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Right. Another measure by the Brazilian government which is mentioned by the representative from Oxfam has to do with tax. Tax is the amount of money you pay to the government depending on your salary and the cost of things you buy… But we have to admit this, Rob: taxes are not popular.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's true. Many people don't like paying tax because they don't receive an immediate benefit from it. Some very rich people try to pay as little as possible. But one billionaire who thinks it's important to pay and create conditions for governments to fight poverty is Bill Gates. The founder of Microsoft earned a lot of money, retired and, with his wife Melinda, created a foundation to help the poor. The BBC asked him what the very rich have to do to help reduce poverty. Let's listen to his answer. What does he say rich people have to be? The word is an adjective.</span>\n<strong><span>Bill Gates, philanthropist<br/></span></strong>\nWell, their obligation of course is to pay their taxes, but our advice to them is that they all look at taking their wealth and being\n<strong>philanthropic</strong>\n- both in their own country and to help the global poorest. That's a full-time work Melinda and I do, we find it very\n<strong>fulfilling</strong>\n, we love seeing the progress.\n<span><strong>Harry<br/></strong>So rich people have to be 'philanthropic'! It means they have to help poor people by giving their money. </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span>\n<span>And he says he and his wife find this giving to the poor 'fulfilling', in other words, it makes them happy and satisfied. </span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that's his message to the very, very, very, very rich in the world! To the… 1%!</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>The 1%...Well, you want the answer to my quiz question now, don't you?</span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. You asked me how much of the global wealth is owned by the richest 1% of the world's population. </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And the options I gave you were: 38%, 48% or 58%</span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And I guessed 38% based on the fact that I couldn't imagine them earning more than that.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I like your thinking, Harry, but I'm afraid the correct answer is actually (b) 48%. The wealthiest 1% will soon own more than the rest of the world's population – that's according to a study by anti-poverty charity Oxfam.</span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I think it's truly shocking that such a small number of people can own so much.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>You're right. It's an amazing statistic. OK, well, we're almost out of time but let's remind ourselves of some of the words that we've said today, Harry.</span>\n<strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong>\n<span>standard of living</span>\n<span>inequality</span>\n<span>minimum wage</span>\n<span>tax</span>\n<span>philanthropic</span>\n<span>fulfilling</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, that's it for today.

Was it…</span>\n<span>a) Alexander Fleming</span>\n<span>b) Albert Sabin</span>\n<span>c) Louis Pasteur</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I don’t know, but I’m going to guess. Probably not (a) because Fleming discovered penicillin. Probably not (c) because Pasteur did pasteurisation. I’m gonna go for (b).</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. It sounds like you know your vaccines. Well, we'll have the answer to that question at the end of the programme. Now, let’s talk about the controversy behind these life-saving vaccines. On one side we have a charity and on the other side, the drug companies.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Which vaccines are they talking about? </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, they’re talking about vaccines which prevent diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, diphtheria and polio. According to Medecins Sans Frontieres, between 2001 and 2014 there was a 68-fold increase in vaccine prices. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that is a lot!</span>\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nIt certainly is. And the group says that there are particular cases in which rich western countries are actually getting vaccines at a cheaper rate than poorer countries. That’s what Medecins Sans Frontieres says, and they’re asking for more transparency around prices.\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Transparency</strong> means clarity, something done in an open way, without secrets.</span>\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes, they want to know the cost of the vaccines. Let’s hear what Rohit Malpani from Medecins Sans Frontieres has to say. See if you can spot the expression Malpani uses to describe how high the price of the vaccine is for some countries.\n<strong><span>Rohit Malpani, from Medecins Sans Frontieres<br/></span></strong>\n<em><span>This is all a black box. It’s a black box in terms of the price they are charging to most countries around the world so they’re often charging prices that are wildly <strong>out of proportion</strong> with their ability to pay. You have Morocco and Tunisia that now are paying higher prices than France for the pneumococcal vaccine. We also simply do not know the cost of production and if GlaxoSmithKline says that it costs more than we are saying it does, then they should simply submit to some sort of audit to ensure that we can <strong>verify</strong> the cost of production. </span></em>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The expression which describes the relationship between the price asked and the ability to pay is ‘out of proportion’. It means it’s unrealistic or exaggerated.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And Malpani from Medecins Sans Frontieres says that Morocco and Tunisia are paying more than France – a much richer country – for a particular vaccine. </span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And his organisation wants transparency. They want to be able <strong>to verify </strong>the cost of production. To verify means to confirm that something is really true and they want the drug company to confirm that the cost to produce the vaccines is really as high as they say it is.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span>\n<span>Well, at this point, we have to hear what the companies say.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, because they argue that they already sell these vaccines at a <strong>discount</strong>, in other words, at a reduced price.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, they do. GlaxoSmithKline says that around 80% of all their vaccines, including the one mentioned by Malpani, are provided to developing countries at a substantial discount. And the company adds that the pneumococcal vaccine is one of the most complex they’ve ever manufactured because it combines 10 vaccines in one. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. On one hand, vaccines take many years of research and these companies want <strong>to make a profit</strong>, which means to sell the product for more than it costs to make it.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>But on the other hand, the lack of vaccines can kill people and it’s really very sad to see people dying of diseases which can be prevented. Some vaccines may be very affordable for a person in a rich country…</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>… but they might cost a fortune to someone in a poor country.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>This is a very complex problem and I’m sure we will talk about this again in the future. But now, let’s go back to the quiz question, Neil.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You asked about the first vaccine developed in a laboratory…</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, I did. The first laboratory-developed vaccine was produced in 1879. It was a vaccine for the animal disease called chicken cholera. I wanted to know the name of the scientist who developed it. Was it Alexander Fleming, Albert Sabin or Louis Pasteur?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said (b) Albert Sabin.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\nAnd you were wrong! The correct answer is (C) Louis Pasteur, who was a French microbiologist. Now, Neil, the option you chose, the American scientist Albert Sabin, in fact developed an oral vaccine against polio in the 1950s – still very useful. And Alexander Fleming from Scotland did indeed discover penicillin, as you said.\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, that is interesting and I’m a bit disappointed that I got it wrong actually.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Okay. Well, that’s it for this programme. Now let’s remember some of the words we used today, Neil. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>to immunise</span>\n<span>charity</span>\n<span>transparency</span>\n<span>out of proportion</span>\n<span>to verify</span>\n<span>discount</span>\n<span>to make a profit</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Thank you.

Welcome to 6 Minute English and with me in the studio is Neil.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Hello, Rob. </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Hello. Feeling bright today, Neil?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I am feeling quite bright and clever, yes!</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That’s good to hear. Well, <strong>you’ll need all your wits about you</strong> – meaning you’ll need to think very quickly in this programme because we’re talking about intelligence, or to be more accurate, <strong>Artificial </strong>Intelligence. And we’ll learn some vocabulary related to the topic so that you can have your own discussion about it. Now, Neil, you know who Professor Stephen Hawking is, right?</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, of course! Yes. Many people say that he’s a <strong>genius</strong> – in other words, he is very, very intelligent. Professor Hawking is one of the most famous scientists in the world and people remember him for his brilliance and also because he communicates using a <strong>synthetic</strong> voice generated by a computer – synthetic means it’s made from something non-natural. Artificial is similar in meaning – we use it when something is man-made to look or behave like something natural. </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, Professor Hawking has said recently that efforts to create thinking machines are a threat to our existence. A <strong>threat</strong> means something which can put us in danger. Now, can you imagine that, Neil?!</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, there’s no denying that good things can come from the creation of Artificial Intelligence. Computers which can think for themselves might be able to find solutions to problems we haven’t been able to solve. But technology is developing quickly and maybe we should consider the consequences. Some of these very clever robots are already surpassing us, Rob. <strong>To surpass</strong> means to have abilities superior to our own.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. Maybe you can remember the headlines when a supercomputer defeated the World Chess Champion Gary Kasparov, to everybody’s astonishment. It was in 1997. What was the computer called, Neil? Was it:</span>\n<span>a)</span>\n<span>Red Menace</span>\n<span>b)</span>\n<span>Deep Blue</span>\n<span>c)</span>\n<span>Silver Surfer</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I don’t know. I think (c) is probably not right. I think Deep Blue. That’s (b) Deep Blue.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Okay. You’ll know if you got it right at the end of the programme. Well, our theme is Artificial Intelligence and when we talk about this we have to mention the movies. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Many science fiction movies have explored the idea of bad computers who want to harm us. One example is 2001: A Space Odyssey. </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, a good film. And another is The Terminator, a movie in which actor Arnold Schwarzenegger played an <strong>android</strong> from the future. An android is a robot that looks like a human. Have you watched that one, Neil?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, I have. And the android is not very friendly. </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>No, it’s not. In many movies and books about robots that think, the robots end up rebelling against their creators. But some experts say the risk posed by Artificial Intelligence is not that computers attack us because they hate us. Their problem is related to their efficiency. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>What do you mean?</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, let’s listen to what philosopher Nick Bostrom has to say. He is the founder of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University. He uses three words when describing what’s inside the mind of a thinking computer. This phrase means ‘to meet their objectives’. What’s the phrase he uses?</span>\n<strong><span>Nick Bostrom, philosopher, Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University<br/></span></strong>\nThe bulk of the risk is not in machines being evil or hating humans but rather that they are indifferent to humans and that in\n<strong>pursuit </strong>\nof\n<strong>their </strong>\nown\n<strong>goals</strong>\nwe humans would suffer as a side effect. Suppose you had a super intelligent AI whose only goal was to make as many paperclips as possible. Human bodies consist of\n<strong>atoms </strong>\nand those atoms could be used to make a lot of really nice paperclips. If you want paperclips it turns out that in the pursuit of this you would have instrumental reasons to do things that would be horrible to humanity.\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A world in which humans become paperclips - wow, that’s scary! But the phrase which means ‘meet their objectives’ is to ‘pursue their goals’.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, it is. So the academic explains that if you’re a computer responsible for producing paperclips, you will pursue your objective at any cost… </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>… and even use atoms from human bodies to turn them into paperclips! Now that’s a horror story, Rob. If Stephen Hawking is worried, I think I might be too. How can we be sure that Artificial Intelligence – be it either a device or software – will have a <strong>moral compass</strong>? </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Ah, a good expression - a moral compass - in other words, an understanding of what is right and what is wrong.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Artificial Intelligence is an interesting topic, Rob. I hope we can chat about it again in the future. But now I’m looking at the clock and we are running out of time, I’m afraid, and I’d like to know if I got the answer to the quiz question right?</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, my question was about a supercomputer which defeated the World Chess Champion Gary Kasparov in 1997. What was the machine’s name? Was it: Red Menace, Deep Blue or Silver Surfer? </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And I think it’s Deep Blue.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, it sounds like you are more intelligent than a computer because you got the answer right. Yes, it was Deep Blue. The 1997 match was actually the second one between Kasparov and Deep Blue, a supercomputer designed by the company IBM and it was specialised in chess-playing. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, I think I might challenge Deep Blue to a game obviously. I’m a bit of a genius myself.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Very good! Good to hear! Anyway, we’ve just got time to remember some of the words and expressions that we’ve used today, Neil.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>They were:</span>\n<span>you’ll need your wits about you </span>\n<span>artificial</span>\n<span>genius</span>\n<span>synthetic</span>\n<span>threat </span>\n<span>to surpass</span>\n<span>to pursue their goals</span>\n<span>moral compass</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Thank you.

    "title": "Should tourists go to Antarctica?",
    "description": "About 37,000 tourists are expected to visit Antarctica this season. But should they be going to a region with such a sensitive environment? Listen to Rob and Neil's conversation and learn some new vocabulary.\n<strong>This week's question:</strong>\nWhat large resource can be found in Antarctica? That's my question to you today. Is Antarctica:\na)    The world's largest coal field\nb)    The world's largest gold source\nc)    The world's largest diamond source\nListen to the programme to find out the answer.\n<strong>wilderness<br/></strong>\narea with no people and no agriculture because the difficult living conditions\n<strong>to set foot<br/></strong>\nto go to\n<strong>ice caps<br/></strong>\nthick layer of ice covering permanently an area of land\n<strong>global warming<br/></strong>\nthe increase in world temperatures due to the presence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere\n<strong>advocates<br/></strong>\npeople who defend a cause or an idea.\n<strong>to disinfect<br/></strong>\nto clean something using chemicals or vacuum to kill or remove bacteria\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nHello, I'm Rob. Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me in the studio is Neil. Hello, Neil.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nHello, Rob.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd in this programme we're talking about tourism, but in a very special place: Antarctica. It is considered the last great\n<strong>wilderness </strong>\non Earth. Wilderness means an area with no people and no agriculture because of the difficult living conditions.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nYes, in Antarctica there are only research stations with scientists and a few tourists.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nNot so few – about 37,000 tourists are expected there this season. Many don't go ashore but there's no denying that it disturbs the environment.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nThat many?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes. We're asking if it is fair for tourists\n<strong>to set foot</strong>\n– it means to go to - such a sensitive environment. We'll also use some vocabulary related to Antarctica. By the way, Neil, do you know a lot about the South Pole?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nI've been reading that the\n<strong>ice caps</strong>\n– these are the thick layers of ice permanently covering a vast area of land in the Arctic and Antarctic - are melting due to\n<strong>global warming</strong>\n…\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes, and global warming is the increase in world temperatures due to the presence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nThis gas and some others have been stopping heat from the Earth escaping into space. You know what, Rob? I would like to visit Antarctica before it melts too much. I want to see the penguins. They are very amusing animals!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThey are, yes. But penguins aside, what large resource can be found in Antarctica? That's my question for you today. Is Antarctica:\na)    The world's largest coal field\nb)    The world's largest gold source\nc)    The world's largest diamond source\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nI'm gonna have a guess - because I don't know - that it's coal (a).\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nCoal. Right. Okay. Well, as usual, we'll give you the right answer at the end of the programme. Well, I love travelling but I wonder how that very sensitive environment in Antarctica is going to be preserved. That's why BBC reporter Juliet Rix's visit to Antarctica caught my attention.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nI bet she is asking the same question as you, Rob.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes she is. Listen to what she has to say about the need to have some level of tourism in the Antarctic. What word does she use to describe people who defend a cause – in this case – the preservation of the region?\n<strong>Juliet Rix, BBC reporter who went to Antarctica<br/></strong>\n<em>I'm all too aware that this is not my habitat. Like a scuba diver under the sea I'm an alien visitor in the penguins' world. Which makes me wonder: should I be here at all? Am I just by setting foot on this extraordinary continent polluting the last great wilderness on Earth? All visitors leave a footprint, admits my tour leader. And we all go to the same places, the accessible coastline, which is also where the penguins and seals go to breed. Nonetheless, he argues, carefully controlled tourism is not just okay but useful. Without a native population of its own, Antarctica needs <strong>advocates</strong>. And tourism creates a global constituency of people ready to support and indeed fund its preservation. Not everyone is convinced that the benefits outweigh the risks, but most are pragmatic:</em>\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nThe reporter uses the word advocates – that's what we call people who defend a cause or an idea.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nJuliet Rix's tour guide told her it's good that some people go to Antarctica and then, when they go back to their countries, they defend conservation and give money to organisations which work for the preservation of the environment.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nSome people might not agree because if there are some companies making profit, it might be difficult to prevent an increase in tourism to Antarctica. And what control do they have over the tourists?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nJuliet Rix tells us about the instructions given to her group when they approached Antarctica. She says that tourists must clean their clothes with a vacuum cleaner before they leave the ship to go on land. But why?\n<strong>Juliet Rix, BBC reporter who went to Antarctica<br/></strong>\n<em>We're given a mandatory briefing before gathering for a “vacuum party”. We bio secure ourselves hovering our clothes and kit and <strong>disinfecting</strong> our boots to ensure we introduce no alien species to Antarctica. There's no eating or smoking on land, and we're instructed to take nothing away, except photographs, and leave nothing behind. Not even a bit of yellow snow. So, don't drink too much at breakfast.</em>\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nThe BBC reporter tells us that the group of tourists has to disinfect their boots. Disinfect means to clean something using chemicals or, in this case, vacuum to kill or remove bacteria. This is to avoid the risk of contaminating the region.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd to go to the toilet before leaving the ship. The ice is not your toilet!\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nNo, it isn't. The penguins have exclusive rights on that! But what do you think about visiting Antarctica, Rob? Are you keen on paying the penguins a visit?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAbsolutely, I would love to go there. What about you, Neil?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nYeah. I'd like to go because as I said, it's all about the penguins.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, let's stop dreaming about exotic trips and go back to the question I asked you earlier in the programme: what large resource can be found in Antarctica? Is it the world's largest coal field; the world's largest gold source or the world's largest diamond source?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd I said coal.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd you are indeed correct. Well done! And now no one is able to mine the coal because the Antarctic Treaty has banned the exploitation of resources for 50 years. What happens after that, who knows? Anyway, we're running out of time so let's remember some of the words we said today, Neil.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nThe words were:\nwilderness\nto set foot\nice caps\nglobal warming\nadvocates\nto disinfect\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThank you. Well, that's it for today. Go to\n<a href=\"http://www.bbclearningenglish.com/\">www.bbclearningenglish.com</a>\nto find more 6 Minute English programmes. Until next time.

    "description": "The jobs market is very competitive - especially when the economy is struggling. Some people go to great lengths to attract the attention of potential employers. Rob and Neil talk about what makes a good CV.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me in the studio today is Neil. Hello, Neil!\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nHello there, Rob!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nNow I bet you have an impressive CV, Neil.\n<strong>CV</strong>\nis short for curriculum vitae - that's a Latin expression we use for the document in which people list their work history, education, interests and abilities. In other parts of the English-speaking world it's called a resume. Now, Neil, I know you are a very good teacher and producer, but does your CV actually shine?\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nWell, I hope it's good enough to impress hiring managers. But it's a challenge to prove on a piece of paper or online document that you're really better than the other people who are competing for the same position.\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nToday we're talking about CVs and you'll learn some words related to this topic, which will especially interest\n<strong>jobseekers </strong>\n- that's what we call people looking for work.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nYes, and jobseekers have to worry about having an impressive CV so they get that call for a job interview.\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nYes, the CV is just the beginning. And, as you mentioned job interviews, I'll ask you a question all about this. According to a recent survey, managers decide quite quickly if they're going to really consider giving a candidate a job or not. So, when you go for a job interview how long do you have, on average, to make a good enough impression for an employer to hire you? Do you have...\na)     Less than 3 minutes\nb)     Less than 5 minutes\nc)     Less than 10 minutes\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, I think it's probably quite short so I'm going to go for: (b) 5 minutes.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, you'll have the correct answer - the result of this survey - at the end of the programme. But people have done all sorts of unusual things to reach the interview level. One of them is Briton Daniel Conway, who went from posing shirtless in the street with the phrase \"employ me\" written on his chest to uploading a video on social media asking to be hired.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAh, this video went\n<strong>viral </strong>\n- it means became popular very quickly. In it his daughter appears next to the phrase \"give my dad a job\".\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes. Daniel Conway tells us about his experience looking for work. Which word does he use when he says he wanted to be noticed?\n<strong>Daniel Conway, former jobseeker<br/> </strong>\n<em>I just thought as a young naive kid that I would kind of walk into a job, but the truth is, you know, there are a lot of good people out there who got just as great skills and I realised at that point that you've got <strong>to stand out</strong> and <strong>get your strengths across</strong>.</em>\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nHe uses the phrasal verb to stand out - it means to be more visible than others in a group so that he can be noticed.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nDan Conway uses another phrasal verb:\n<strong>get your strengths across</strong>\n- to get something across means to make something clear. In this case he wants the employer to understand how good he is as a potential employee, his strengths and his good qualities.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd did he get a job?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, yes, he did. And I'm glad to say that after four years this 29-year-old man got a job marketing vitamins!\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, we can say that he was good at marketing himself.\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nYes, we can. Well, he was bold and courageous in his attempts to catch potential employers' attention. He showed a quality described by career coach Corinne Mills. Listen to what she says and tell me: what is the quality jobseekers have to show for sure.\n<strong>Corinne Mills, MD - Personal Career Management<br/></strong>\n<em>You've got to be <strong>confident</strong>! I mean, if you are not confident about your skills and abilities, then why should an employer have faith in you? So, don't be <strong>modest</strong>. This is your opportunity to really show your skills and experience and what a great performer you're gonna be in the job.</em>\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nThe career coach says you've got to be confident! It means self-assured, believe in your capacity to do things. And sometimes we feel that it isn't nice to say \"I'm very good at this\" or \"I'm wonderful at that\" but she advises you not to be modest.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nExactly. Modest means humble, moderate when talking about your abilities.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nYou know, Rob, I've got some top tips for people writing their CV.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK, well, let's have them.\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nYes. Here is the first one: you have to be\n<strong>concise </strong>\n- it means brief, give the information in a few words. Maybe you could write a brief profile at the top and keep the CV to just two pages.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThank you. That's a good bit of advice. And I think you should give evidence of success in previous jobs. If a presentation you did helped you to get a client you should include it there. And be\n<strong>accurate</strong>\n, in other words, be precise and tell the truth. Don't invent things.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd you should also remember to check your spelling and grammar!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes, that's very important! Well, we wish everybody success when writing and sending out their CV, and we hope they are called for a job interview, in which they have a very short period of time to leave a good impression...\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nIndeed! So how long after all is this period of time, according to your survey? Did I get the answer to the question you asked at the beginning of the programme right?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, I asked you: how long do you have on average to make a good enough impression for an employer to hire you? Do you have less than 3 minutes, less than 5 minutes or less than 10 minutes?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd I said less than 5 minutes.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd you're wrong. The correct answer is actually less than 10 minutes, so you'd have a little bit longer. Jobseekers have on average just six minutes and 25 seconds during the first meeting to impress potential employers. That's according to a new study from the website monster.co.uk. And we're almost out of time. So let's remember some of the words we said today, Neil.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nCV (curriculum vitae)\nviral\nto stand out\nget your strengths across\nconfident\nmodest\nconcise\naccurate\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nThank you.

Welcome to 6 Minute English and with me in the studio is Rob.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nHello, Neil.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nHow are you today?\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nI'm fine, thanks. How are you?\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nI'm very well, actually. The weather has been nice lately, hasn't it?\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nYes, it has. The winter has been mild this year but... according to the forecast there might be some snow in parts of the country next week... And, you know, that's good because I love snow and we haven't seen much of it for quite a while. It's only rain, isn't it I...\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nOK! OK! Enough! Enough now or they're going to think it's true that British people only talk about the weather!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nRight.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nIn this programme we're talking about conversation and how to start talking with people you don't know. In short: how to make\n<strong>small talk</strong>\n.\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nRight. Well, small talk is what we call a polite and informal conversation about things which aren't really important or meaningful when meeting people socially - like at a party, for example.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd in this programme you'll learn some vocabulary about communication. But first, a question: Rob, when do babies usually start talking? Is it when they are...\na) 9 months\nb) 16 months or\nc) 18 months\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, I know they start making noises at quite an early age. And I guess if that's talking, let me say (a) 9 months.\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nOK. Well, we'll have the answer to that question at the end of the programme. Small talk is a social skill. Some people feel\n<strong>awkward</strong>\n- it means they feel uncomfortable, embarrassed - when they go to a party and don't know many people there.\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nLiz Brewer, the author of 'The Ultimate Guide to Party Planning and\n<strong>Etiquette</strong>\n', knows a lot about what to do on these occasions. Etiquette is the set of rules which indicate what behaviour in a society is acceptable and what is not.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nYes, the author knows a lot about etiquette. Let's listen to her advice. What expression does she use to describe the act of attempting to start a conversation with someone?\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Liz Brewer, author of 'The Ultimate Guide to Party Planning and Etiquette'<br/></strong>\n<em>You walk into a room, there's a sea of faces, well... (the) first thing we do is... it's the weather. We do it because we are in fact <strong>breaking the ice</strong>. That is a code. That means 'I want to talk to you'. It's an easy subject, it's not too penetrating. We're very <strong>private </strong>people, we don't like to give too much information. So we are on safe ground. We start off with the weather. If that goes well, we then take it one step further.</em>\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nLiz Brewer talks about breaking the ice. It means approaching someone you don't know and starting a friendly conversation with them.\n<strong><br/></strong>\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nAnd when you break the ice, talking about things which are not specific is the best way. You don't start a chat asking straight away where people live or what they do for a living.\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nAnd, as the author said, we are very private people. Private describes someone who doesn't like to give away their personal information, opinions or share their feelings. So we need more time to open up to people we've just met.\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nGood. So now you know what to do at a party when you don't know the other guests.\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nBut, Neil. There is one particular situation I'm not sure how to deal with. This is when I forget the name of the person I've been making small talk with.\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nYes, I know what that's like. You might not feel comfortable about allowing the person to realise you didn't really catch their name. It might sound\n<strong>rude</strong>\n.\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nYes, that's right. I don't want to sound rude - which means ill-mannered or unpleasant. The person I've just managed to approach might think I don't care.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nLet's see what tip author on etiquette Liz Brewer has for us. Which words does she use instead of \"I have forgotten\"?\n<strong>Liz Brewer, author of \"The Ultimate Guide to Party Planning &amp; Etiquette\"<br/></strong>\n<em>You can say \"Oh, just your name... it has just <strong>slipped my mind</strong> for the moment\". And they say \"Paul\", (you say) \"Oh no, no, no, I know you are Paul, it was the surname\". Or they give you the surname and then you add the other. As I say, small talk is a code towards getting information and going further. Once you feel comfortable, then you can have these wonderful in-depth conversations. Those are the kinds of things you want to probably do later.</em>\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nLiz Brewer says \"your name has just slipped my mind\", it's a gentler way of saying that they've just forgotten the person's name. And pretending that you knew the person's name but you want the other name is a clever trick.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nYes, it might sound like you forgot the name, but not completely. And this author shows that you have to interact with people in a charming way.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes... well, my co-presenter... your name has just slipped my mind for the moment...\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nCome on, Rob. You know! You know it's Neil.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes, it is Neil. I'm just practising my social skills there.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, I'm afraid you have to practise some other time because... well, I don't want to sound rude but we are running out of time. Let me give you the correct answer to the quiz question now.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes. You asked me \"When do babies usually start talking?\" and you gave me three options.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nYes, and the options were 9 months, 16 months or 18 months.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd I went for the first one, 9 months. Was I right?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nYou were wrong. The correct answer was (c) 18 months. Now, according to the website webmd.com, there are some milestones in speech development. At 6 months, your baby begins babbling with different sounds. For example, your baby may say \"ba-ba\" or \"da-da\". And then, after that, at 9 months, babies can understand a few basic words. At the age of 18 months babies say up to 10 simple words.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAh, interesting stuff. And we are still learning words now, aren't we?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWe are. Well, enough of this small talk. Let's remember some of the words we used today, Rob.\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThey were:\nsmall talk\nawkward\netiquette\nbreaking the ice\nprivate\nrude\nslipped my mind\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nThat's it for this programme.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me in the studio today is Neil. Hello, Neil.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nHi. Hi Rob!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAre you alright, Neil? Are you playing on your\n<strong>smartphone</strong>\nagain, are you?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nErr... what was that? Yeah, sorry, Rob... just doing something on my smartphone, you know, the kind of phone which allows you to go online.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOh I can see that. But are you waiting for a call?\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nNo. No, I just carry it with me at all times. Where I go, the phone goes. No phone, no Neil!\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nOK, but why do you need your phone so much?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWhy?! What if I need to need to go somewhere? How will I find my way? What about the weather? Will it rain today? I need to know these things.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWhy don't you just look up in the sky and see if it is cloudy?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nLook up to see if it is going to rain?! I have an\n<strong>app</strong>\n- which is short for an application, which is a computer programme for a specific purpose. My app tells me the weather... and this one does all the maths I need... and here's one for translations, and this one here... can tell me what I'm going to...\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK, OK, OK, I get the point. Today we're talking about computers - and we'll bring you some words\n<strong>connected</strong>\nwith the digital age.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nConnected -\n<strong>to connect</strong>\n- we use this verb a lot. It means 'to link, or join, one thing to another thing. In this case, connected means 'linked to the internet'.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK, I can see you are very excited about computers. So that's what my question is all about. The first commercially produced \"desktop computer\" was designed and produced by the Italian company Olivetti and presented at an event in New York. When did it happen? Was it in:\na)     1955\nb)     1965 or\nc)     1975\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, I think it's (a) 1955.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nVery interesting. You'll get the right answer at the end of the programme. Now, let's talk about computers. You can't live without them but American technology writer Nicholas Carr, the author of a book called 'The Glass Cage - where automation is taking us', thinks they might cause problems.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nProblems?! They cause us problems when they\n<strong>crash</strong>\n- that's what we say when our computer suddenly stops working.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, not just that. Let's listen to Nicholas Carr. He says if we rely too much on computers we lose something. But what is it?\n<strong>American technology writer Nicholas Carr<br/></strong>\n<em>The ability of computers to do things we used to do is growing astronomically and we're rushing to hand over to computers tasks, activities - both in our work lives and in our personal lives - and what you begin to see is what is often called a <strong>de-skilling</strong> effect. The person becoming reliant on computers; because they are not exercising their own <strong>talents</strong>, those talents begin to fade. And we begin to lose, as a result, the unique things that human beings can do that computers can't: feel <strong>empathy</strong>, take a broad perspective, interpret all the stuff that can't be turned into data.</em>\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nAccording to Nicholas Carr, using computers means that we are losing skills - he talks about 'de-skilling'. A skill is the ability to do something well because we've practised it.\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nAnd he also talks about the loss of talent - talent is a natural ability to do something - you didn't have to learn it, you're just naturally good at it. It's something we're all born with. Carr says that relying on computers means our talent is fading because we don't use it any more.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd he goes even further and says we're losing some of the things that make us human, like empathy, the ability to imagine and understand what other people might be feeling.\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nSo, do you agree with this writer, Neil?\n<strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\nI think he's got a point actually.\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nIt's like the friendships we make on social media. It is nice to get to know new people in different countries, but we have to remember that it's important to talk to people face-to-face too.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nSo... maybe we shouldn't use\n<strong>GPS</strong>\nto find our way around all the time. GPS, the global positioning system which gives us directions with the help of satellites orbiting the Earth... instead, have a conversation with someone - ask for directions.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes, and perhaps we can give the\n<strong>spellchecker</strong>\na miss occasionally. A spellchecker is a very useful piece of software which helps us avoid making spelling mistakes when we're typing on a computer but... it is good to actually learn how to spell the words properly and not leave everything to the machine.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nGood idea, Rob. I'll try not to rely so much on digital technology. Computers are here to stay and they'll become more and more sophisticated, but we have to remember they are just tools.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes, computers are here to stay. And by the way, when was the first commercially produced \"desktop computer\" launched? As I told you, it was designed and created by Olivetti and launched in New York. But when was it launched? Was it: 1955, 1965 or 1975?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd I said 1955.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nPerhaps you should ask your smartphone because the correct answer is actually (b) 1965.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nI don't believe it!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThe computer was called Programma 101 and it was presented at the New York World's Fair. They sold 44,000 units all over the world. The initial price in the US was US$ 3,200. Well, we are almost out of time so let's remind ourselves of some of the words we said today, Neil.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nsmartphone\napp (application)\nto connect\ncrash\nskill\ntalent\nempathy\nGPS (Global Positioning System)\nspellchecker\n<strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\nThank you.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me in the studio today is Rob.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Hello, Neil.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Traditionally, January is the month in which people try to make their New Year's resolutions work. Some want to get fit, others swear they will drink less alcohol and there are those who want to stop smoking.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Many people might wish to stop smoking here in England because, according to a plan, smoking in cars with children will be banned under new laws put forward by the government.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And a similar move is being discussed in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Today we're talking about this new proposal restricting where people are allowed to smoke. And you'll learn some related vocabulary so you can have your own discussion on the subject.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>We usually talk about smoking as a<strong> habit</strong> – that's what we do every day without even thinking and it's difficult to give up. Well, this ban is going to cause <strong>controversy</strong>, in other words, disagreement expressed in an angry, public way. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil</span></strong>\n<span> <br/>Yes, smokers are trying hard to carry on enjoying their cigarettes. But there are a couple of places where they've already lost the battle, Rob.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And where's that?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I'm giving you a chance to tell me. Bans on smoking in cars where children are present already exist in some regions of particular countries. Is it:</span>\n<span>a)</span>\n<span>in the French capital, Paris</span>\n<span>b)</span>\n<span>in some US states</span>\n<span>c)</span>\n<span>in Greece</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I don't know but I'm gonna go for b) in some US states.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK. Well, we'll have the answer to that question at the end of the programme. </span>\n<span>Now let's hear the argument in favour of a ban. Here's Dr Hilary Wareing. She is the director of the Tobacco Control Collaborating Centre, which works with the World Health Organisation.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>The World Health Organisation is <strong>campaigning </strong>to discourage people from smoking. Campaigning means working in an organised and active way to achieve an objective.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Listen out for what Dr Wareing calls the smoke from other people's cigarettes.  </span>\n<strong><span>Dr Hilary Wareing, Tobacco Control Collaborating Centre in Britain<br/></span></strong>\n<em><span>Those children who are exposed to <strong>second-hand smoke</strong> in cars are more likely to end up going to their doctors with respiratory infections, more likely to end up going to hospital with a respiratory infection and much more likely to get a wheeze or actually have <strong>asthma</strong> through their childhood. </span></em>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So Dr Wareing calls smoke from other people's cigarette <strong>second-hand smoke</strong>. Second-hand is something which has had a previous owner.  </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And she also mentions <strong>asthma</strong>. This is an illness you hear a lot about when people discuss the effects of tobacco smoke and pollution on people's lungs. People with asthma sometimes find it difficult to breathe. You faced this problem as a child, didn't you, Rob?</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Asthma? No, but when I was a kid my brother, who was much older than me, used to smoke in the car. Now, the smell was terrible, the smoke bothered me a lot and even if I don't have asthma now, I just don't like breathing in smoke. If people want to smoke, it's their personal choice, but not near me.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The proposal under discussion here in England includes a <strong>fine</strong> of up to £50 – that's about $80 – imposed on the driver of the car if there's somebody smoking when there's a child passenger.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>A fine is the money you pay as a punishment for having broken the law. And the driver is responsible, even if he is not the person smoking in the car. This will really cause some conflict.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It probably will. But it's difficult to find anyone who doesn't defend a child's right to be healthy. Children are <strong>vulnerable</strong> – vulnerable means they are exposed to harm and can't defend themselves. We have to protect them. But many smokers see this proposal with suspicion.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, in the last few years, smokers have seen restrictions in their ability to smoke. In many countries they aren't allowed to smoke in closed public places like bars anymore. And cigarette packages show disturbing pictures of diseased lungs.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Smoking doesn't look so cool anymore. One of the smokers suspicious of the new ban is Hayley. This British driver said she doesn't smoke when her children are on board. But that's as far as she goes in agreeing with the ban.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>What objection – I mean what reason for disagreeing – is she raising?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Listen out for the two words Hayley uses when talking about the physical area surrounding her which she feels is very personal.</span>\n<strong><span>Hayley, a smoker<br/></span></strong>\n<em><span>If they are going to stop it with people in the cars with their children I completely agree with that. I completely understand where they are coming from, but to take it to the next level of stopping it even if you haven't got children in the car then I think that's a little bit beyond people's <strong>personal space</strong>, really.</span></em>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hayley talks about her personal space – it means the area around her body which she feels is hers and if invaded makes her feel uncomfortable. In this case, Hayley feels that her car is her personal space and she should be able to choose if she wants to smoke in it.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, it seems that enforcing this ban will be a bit of a challenge for the authorities. There's a ban on smoking inside buses but I tell you, sometimes I can smell smoke from somewhere.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>They breach the law at their own peril. But other places have managed to implement the ban on smoking in cars with child passengers. So what's the answer to the question you put earlier in the programme, Neil?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Where are people not allowed by law to smoke in private cars with children on board: is it Paris, some US states or Greece?</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, I said some US states.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And you were correct!</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Oh good.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, the proposal here in England has yet to be voted for in Parliament and it might be implemented only by October. </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So plenty of time there for a good debate. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes but two people who can't continue the discussion, at least for the moment, are both of us. That's because we've run out of time, Rob. Let's just remember some of the words used today.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>habit</span>\n<span>controversy</span>\n<span>campaigning</span>\n<span>second-hand smoke</span>\n<span>asthma</span>\n<span>fine</span>\n<span>vulnerable</span>\n<span>personal space</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's it for today.

Hello, Neil!</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Hi there, Rob! </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Today we are talking about a very serious topic: bullying. And you're going to learn some vocabulary related to this topic.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>It's a serious matter because it can leave people traumatised. </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/>Traumatised</strong>, it means, they end up with emotional wounds which affect them psychologically. Bullies want to intimidate people.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/>To intimidate</strong>, in other words, to make people fear them. Yes, it does make people feel they can't help themselves - they're powerless. They feel <strong>helpless</strong>.  </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Unfortunately, bullying has been increasing in the workplace in spite of laws against it. Let's go for some figures. Are you ready for a question, Neil? </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, I am.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>The Workplace Bullying Institute based in the US conducted a survey last year. How much of the American workforce has experienced bullying at work? Was it: </span>\n<span>a) 7%</span>\n<span>b) 27%</span>\n<span>c) 47%</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, I don't know but I’m going to go for 27%.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK. I'll give you the answer by the end of the programme.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>I'm very keen to know, Rob. Intimidating people is a bad thing but some might say that, well, aggression is part of human nature.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, that's an interesting point, Neil. I can imagine big strong men imposing their will by force in the Stone Age, but behaving this way now probably isn't a good idea. The California-based anthropologist Christopher Boehm explains. Listen and then tell me: what made bullying go out of fashion?</span>\n<strong><span>Christopher Boehm, Anthropologist at the University of California, US<br/></span></strong>\n<em><span>About a quarter of a million years ago, humans began to hunt zebras and antelope. And they had <strong>to cooperate</strong> to do so because their weapons were rather primitive and they did not want <strong>alpha males</strong> to be dominating the carcass after it was killed. So the thing that everyone else did was to start killing alpha males. Bullies simply were not tolerated.   </span></em>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Ah, people had <strong>to cooperate</strong> with each other - in other words, to work together for their mutual benefit. They were hunting animals for food.  </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, and nobody wanted the <strong>alpha male</strong> - the strong man in the group who wanted to dominate everybody else - to take all the meat for himself.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>So about 250,000 years ago, when human society was evolving, people realised it wasn't good for the community to have a bully around. </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\nNo. So if we make a big jump in history and back to the 21st century, well, modern companies value cooperation. People's wellbeing matters too.\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That's right. Many countries have laws against bullying which is part of the companies' human resources policy. </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span><strong>Human Resources</strong> - also known by the initials HR - is the department which hires new employees and stores information about their career at the company. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And what sort of behaviour is considered bullying in the civilised world?</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That's what Helene Guldberg is about to explain to us. She's a specialist in developmental psychology. What's the main thing that defines bullying?<br/><br/></span>\n<strong><span>Helene Guldberg, developmental psychologist<br/></span></strong>\n<em><span>Something that is <strong>intentional</strong> on the part of the perpetrator; it has to involve some kind of power imbalance, so it's not an argument between equals, and it's something that is repetitive. So it's not a one off rage by one person against another. The intent is to cause harm, which can be psychological or physical. </span></em>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>To be considered bullying, the behaviour has to be <strong>intentional</strong>, which means it has to be planned or deliberate. </span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And also has to happen many times and involve power. </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, indeed. One person has to have more power than the other.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>You know, Rob, this idea of intention is very important, because some people are just more confident and demanding then others. They might say that they didn't mean to cause any harm. They don't mean to bully anyone.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. But it can be interpreted differently. Darren Treadway, at the State University of New York, studied bullying in the workplace. He uses a word which means the way someone interprets something they see or hear. Which word is it?<br/><br/></span>\n<strong><span>Darren Treadway, at the State University of New York, US<br/></span></strong>\n<em><span>At the end of the day, if the target feels as if they're being bullied, the corporation needs to make sure they're addressing that feeling. If you're the supervisor who's... your subordinate says that they're being bullied by you or abused by you, while you may not feel you're doing that, it's your responsibility as a communicator to make sure that they are getting the accurate <strong>perception</strong> of your behaviour. Being known as a bully is a stigma that nobody in a corporation wants.</span></em>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>It's <strong>perception</strong>. According to Darren Treadway, bullying is a matter of perception - the way some action is interpreted by a person, in this case, a subordinate. </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And supervisors have to be aware of how their subordinates see their behaviour. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's all a matter of communication. </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, indeed. But we are running out of time, I'm afraid. Let's go back to the question I put to you earlier in the programme. It's about a survey by the Workplace Bullying Institute. I asked how much of the American workforce has experienced bullying in the workplace. The options were 7%, 27% and 47%.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And I guessed 27%.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And you guessed very well. The answer is indeed 27%. What do you think about that?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, it's depressingly high, isn't it?</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, it is. OK. Well, before we go, could you remind us of some of the words that we've heard today, Neil?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes. We've heard: </span>\n<span>traumatised</span>\n<span>to intimidate</span>\n<span>helpless</span>\n<span>to cooperate</span>\n<span>alpha male</span>\n<span>human resources</span>\n<span>intentional</span>\n<span>perception</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Right.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm joined today, at the start of a brand new year, by Neil.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello, Rob! I'm really looking forward to 2015, but I have to say that last year was great. So great I'm thinking about creating my own time capsule.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Really? A <strong>time capsule</strong>? You mean a kind of box or container where you can store objects and information so that people in the future - yourself included - will know how we lived at this particular time?</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That's it! And I'm already collecting items. My old mobile phone which I don't use anymore. And a woolly jumper with a snowman on it my granny gave me that I never wear...</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>You never wear? </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's a pretty silly jumper, Rob. She said it's to <strong>remind</strong> <strong>me</strong> of how much she loves me. Remind, which means, makes me remember - but all it makes me think of is that she still treats me like a child! I'll include the Christmas card which came with it! </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, you've got to choose the items you wish to keep as a memory of our time very carefully. It's a <strong>historical record</strong> - that usually means a piece of writing or a narrative of events at a particular time. Well, let's discuss time capsules and vocabulary related to memory. But first, a question to test your knowledge of time capsules. The International Time Capsule Society is based at Oglethorpe University in Atlanta, in the US, and it studies these artefacts. According to this organisation, how many time capsules are estimated to exist in the world today? Is it: </span>\n<span>a)         up to 15,000</span>\n<span>b)         up to 150,000 or</span>\n<span>c)         up to 1,500,000</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm gonna go for (a) 15,000.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>OK, up to 15,000.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>That's the one.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. Well, as usual, you'll have the answer to that question at the end of the programme. Right, now, let's talk more about time capsules. One of them was in the news in the last couple of weeks. A capsule was found in a public building in Boston. </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ah, I've heard about this. Historians believe it was put there by Samuel Adams and Paul Revere, and other American revolutionaries in the 18th century! </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. Let's listen to BBC reporter Rajini Vaidyanathan. Can you tell me exactly where this time capsule was hidden?</span>\n<strong><span>Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC reporter in Washington<br/></span></strong>\n<span><em>It was during repair work at the Massachusetts State House in Boston that the time capsule was discovered hidden in the <strong>cornerstone</strong>. It’s thought the time capsule was first placed there in the 1795, when the building was constructed. Officials believe it contains old coins and newspapers which could have <strong>deteriorated</strong> over time.</em> </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ah, the time capsule was hidden in the cornerstone, which is a stone representing the starting place in the construction of a monumental building. Usually it has the date carved on it.</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes the time capsule's items date from over 200 years ago, so the historians are concerned about opening it. The newspapers particularly might have <strong>deteriorated</strong>, decayed or decomposed over time.  </span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Paper doesn't last long. But my old mobile phone - the one I'm going to put in my own time capsule - will be <strong>eternal</strong>, it means it will exist forever! And the historians of the future will be grateful! </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, if you want to make the historians happy, put things which are current in your life and things you actually use in your time capsule. There are famous capsules to be opened: the American company Westinghouse created two of them. One for the 1939 New York World's Fair and the other for the same event in 1964.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And when are they going to open it? </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>In the 25th century! <strong> </strong></span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Wow! Well, that's it, Rob. I'm going home and I'm going to start working on my own time capsule!</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Good. I'm glad to see you're so enthusiastic, Neil. But be careful not to make the mistake these guys in the Writtle Junior School here in England made. They put their items in a box 25 years ago and they buried the capsule in the garden.</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And what happened to it? It isn't centuries later but it must be interesting for these people who are now adults to see what's inside. </span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, it would have been interesting. But it didn't happen. Listen to Headteacher Nick Taylor and tell me why they didn't open their time capsule.</span>\n<strong><span>Nick Taylor, Writtle School Headteacher<br/></span></strong>\n<em>There were letters in it, coins, various things so we called in Writtle Heritage and they had a good explore around the garden with their <strong>metal detectors</strong>, and they couldn't find any evidence of it. I think we’ve dug about three holes around our school garden but we had to stop because we were slowly destroying it.</em>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>They forgot where they buried it!</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. And they used <strong>metal detectors</strong> - electronic devices which can find metallic objects underground - and even so they couldn't find their time capsule! And before I forget, let's go back to the question I asked at the beginning of the programme.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>You asked how many time capsules are estimated to exist in the world today. </span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, and the options were up to 15,000, up to 150,000 or up to 1,500,000. And you said...</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Yes, I said up to 15,000.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>And this is the right answer!</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Hurrah!</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well done! Yes, the International Time Capsule Society has set up a registry of time capsules, and it estimates there are 10,000 to 15,000 time capsules worldwide. And the organisation believes that more than 80% of all time capsules are lost and will not be opened on their intended date.</span>\n<strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Well, I will remember where I kept mine. That's for sure.</span>\n<strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span>Good for you. Well, that's it from us for the moment. We've been talking about time and... we've run out of it. But let's just remember some of the words used today. Neil...</span>\n<span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>time capsule</span>\n<span>remind</span>\n<span>historical record</span>\n<span>cornerstone</span>\n<span>deteriorated</span>\n<span>eternal</span>\n<span>metal detectors</span>\n<span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's it for today.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm joined today by Finn.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nHi Rob! Merry Christmas everyone!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes. Merry Christmas! Today we're talking about this celebration. It's a Christian festival but its message of peace among people is universal.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nIt's a pity that today we are far from that - from a moment of absolute peace and\n<strong>goodwill</strong>\n. Now, goodwill means a cooperative attitude.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nBut there was once a brief moment in history when the human spirit rose above wars.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nAh, you must be talking about the Christmas Truce which happened in World War One, in 1914!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nIt's the perfect occasion to talk about it, because this year marks the\n<strong>centenary</strong>\n- the 100 year anniversary - of the start of Britain's involvement in this European conflict. And we'll look at some related vocabulary during the programme. But, before we go into this extraordinary event, a question about the First World War, Finn.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nFor me... well... I'm not an expert on the First World War so... we'll let's see how I do...\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nI'm sure you'll know the answer to this one. It's about letters. People didn't have email in the early 20th century so they wrote lots of letters. But do you know how many letters were delivered to the front - the place where the fighting happened - every week? Were there:\na)       one million\nb)       five million or\nc)       an incredible twelve million letters?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nRight. Well, I know there were a lot of people at the front but I'm going to say a) one million.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK. Well, as usual, you'll have the answer to that question at the end of the programme. Right, now, let's talk about this\n<strong>unofficial truce</strong>\nwhich happened 100 years ago in the Western Front of the First World War.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYes, so a truce is an agreement between people to stop fighting, with no winner or loser. Now, it's\n<strong>unofficial</strong>\n- which means it's not authorised by people in a position of authority, in this case, the governments involved in the war. So the soldiers just decided to simply stop fighting. How was this possible, Rob? How did this happen?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, soldiers from both\n<strong>trenches</strong>\n, all of a sudden, started to\n<strong>fraternise</strong>\n- which means they began to meet each other socially.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nAnd the trenches were big holes dug by soldiers from which they attacked the enemy. Living conditions were terrible in these holes.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThis truce might have had something to do with the bad conditions in these trenches. Let's hear what German historian Michael Jurgs has to say about the event. Which expression does he use to describe how the soldiers felt about the war?\n<strong>INSERT</strong>\n<strong>Michael Jurgs, author of The Small Peace in the Great War<br/></strong>\nI think it happened because they were all\n<strong>fed up with</strong>\nthe war. They were promised they would be at home again, Christmas 1914 and after five months of the World War One, there were already a million dead young people, eighteen, nineteen, twenty years old. And at Christmas night the muddy weather became frosty and cold and then from the German trenches, from the German trenches - that sounds unbelievable because always Germans started wars, or joined wars - began the song, 'Silent Night, Holy Night'. That was the beginning.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nThe German historian said the soldiers were fed up with the war - which is an informal way of saying they were bored, or annoyed with it.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThe war was continuing and they wished they were home with their families. One night, it was cold and the German soldiers started to sing a song... a carol...\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYes. A carol is a happy song with a religious element - usually a Christmas song. And the carol they sang was (sings a bit of Silent Night).\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\n(Joins in the singing) Yes. That's the carol 'Silent Night, Holy Night' and it\n<strong>broke the ice</strong>\nbetween the soldiers. That means it made these men, who didn't know each other personally, more relaxed.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nAnd you know Rob? I really find it fascinating how spontaneous all of this was!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nIt was indeed.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nSo how did the authorities respond to this?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThey didn't like it at all. They banned this sort of fraternising and it didn't happen again. But not before the soldiers from opposing armies played some football together.\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nFootball?!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes. They played a match in\n<strong>no-man's-land</strong>\n! That's a strip of land between enemy sides over which nobody has control. It was the area between the English trench and the German trench.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYou know, it's a really nice story, isn't it? It's quite a touching story, Rob.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes, and very inspiring. Well, our time is almost up so let's get the right answer to the quiz question. I asked you how many letters were delivered to the front every week. The options were: one million, five million or twelve million.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nAnd I said one million, Rob.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd you were a long way off.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nOh, really?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes. The correct answer is (c) twelve million letters.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nTwelve million a week?!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes, a week. By the end of the war, two billion letters and 114 million parcels had been delivered to the front.  According to statistics, 65 million people around the world fought in this war, which ended in 1918.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nThat's really quite incredible Rob!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nSome incredible figures there. OK. Let's remember some of the words we explained today.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nThey were:\ngoodwill\ncentenary\ntruce\nunofficial\ntrenches\nfraternise\nfed up with\ncarol\nbroke the ice\nno-man's-land\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThank you, Finn.

In the playground – that's the area in the schoolyard where children play during their break between lessons – they speak 42 languages?! Wow.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes.

Is it:\na) India\nb) Nigeria\nc) South Africa\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nGood question. I would say India or Nigeria... Let's say Nigeria.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nOK. I will reveal the answer at the end of the programme! So let's talk about Byron Court, a school with 600 pupils in north-west London. The school gets high\n<strong>marks</strong>\nfor\n<strong>integration</strong>\n.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nMarks - so here you mean scores in tests or exams. They get high marks for integration - integration means bringing people together - as they have pupils from all over the world.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes, they come from places as far apart as Iraq, Somalia, India, Romania and Slovakia. Many are children of immigrants and refugees.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nSo how difficult is it for these children to learn English?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, let's listen to this pupil from Byron Court. Where did she learn her first words in English?\n<strong><strong>Pupil, Byron Court school, London<br/></strong></strong>\n<em>When I was two years old I went to nursery and then I learnt a bit of English there. And when I came here I got to learn all my English.</em>\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nShe says she began to learn English at nursery - that's a place where very young children are looked after while their parents are at work.\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> </strong>\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nByron Court's\n<strong>head teacher</strong>\n- the person in charge of a school - believes children feel integrated because she tries to celebrate all the different cultures and avoids suggesting one culture is better than the other.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nIt all sounds very nice, Rob, but I wonder what happens in the classroom. I mean, many pupils are learning basic words in English while, at the same time, studying things like science and maths also in English. So, quite a challenge?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nIt is indeed a big problem.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nSo does this lower\n<strong>educational standards</strong>\n? Those are the knowledge and skills students should have at a particular level.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes it does, but not for long, says Martyn Pendergast, educational officer at Brent Council, that's the area where the school is located. Listen out for the verb he uses which means testing children's performance.\n<strong>Martin Pendergast, educational officer at Brent Council<br/></strong>\n<em>In Brent our children perform just below national averages when they are assessed at seven years old. But by the time they're 11 they've caught up with national standards, and at 16 they're flying.</em>\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nHe says they are assessed - which means tested and given scores - when they are seven years old. At that time they have worse results than children in other British schools.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nBut by the time they celebrate their 11th birthday, they've caught up - they've become equal with pupils of their age elsewhere in the country.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nAnd by 16, he says, \"they are flying\", which is a nice way to describe these children's progress. It's good for them because they end up as\n<strong>bilingual</strong>\nadults - speaking two languages fluently.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nSo their effort pays off. At Byron Court the concern is more about pupils who are native speakers of English.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nParents worry about their children not learning much.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nMaybe the best thing is for everybody to try to learn a second language. Not a bad thing in today's small world.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nTalking about learning languages, I want to know if I got the answer to your question right. The question was about the country with the most official languages.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd the options I put to you were India, Nigeria or South Africa.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nAnd I said Nigeria. But... maybe I think India now. Can I change my mind?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYou can if you want because you'd still be wrong.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nOh, no, really?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThe country with most official languages is the Republic of South Africa with 11 languages.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nEleven!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nInterestingly India has 18 languages that are recognised by its constitution and can be considered as official, however, the difference is that each language is recognised as the official language of a certain area such as Kashmir, for example.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nOK. Right. So I was kind of right in a different way.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThe overall official language is Hindi.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nFascinating! Well, lots of languages to learn, in any case.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nI'll stick with English for now. It's time to wrap up.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nOK.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nSo let's remember some of the words we explained today.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nThey were:\nrusty\nplayground\nmarks\nintegration\nnursery\nhead teacher\neducational standards\nassessed\ncaught up\nbilingual\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\n<em>Merci beaucoup</em>\n. Thank you, Finn. That's it for today. But please do log on to bbclearningenglish.com to find more 6 Minute English. Bye for now!\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nBye or, as we say in China, 再见!"

    "title": "Laughter is bad for you",
    "description": "Laughing is good for you, isn't it? True, it can reduce anger, anxiety and stress, but according to the BMJ, laughter can occasionally have harmful side-effects for certain people. They reviewed over 700 academic papers and came up with a list of health problems which can be caused by laughing.\nFinn and Rob discuss the pros and cons of laughing, and explain some health-related vocabulary.\n<strong>laughter is the best medicine<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\na phrase which means that laughing is a good way to be happy and stop worrying\n<strong>no laughing matter<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nsomething very serious that you should not make jokes about\n<strong>fainting<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nlosing consciousness for a short time, usually falling to the ground\n<strong>gullet<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nthe tube through which food passes from the mouth to the stomach\n<strong>lungs<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nthe organs in your chest which you use to breathe\n<strong>dislocated<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\n(of a bone) moved suddenly out of its correct position\n<strong>jaw<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nthe lower part of your face (your chin and lower teeth)\n<strong>heart attack<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\na serious medical problem when the heart stops working properly and causes chest pain\n<strong>to have the last laugh<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nto finally be successful, often after an argument or disagreement\nNote: This is not a word-for-word transcript\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nHello and welcome to 6 Minute English with me, Finn.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd me, Neil.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nNeil, I'm going to tell you a joke.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nOK, come on.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWhich part of learning the English language are boxers best at?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWhich part of English are boxers best at?  I don't know.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nPunch-uation (punctuation).\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nThat's actually quite funny.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nDo you really think so?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nI do, yes.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWell, I'm glad I made you laugh. But you might not thank me for it after the programme.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWhy's that?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nBecause a paper published by the British Medical Journal says that laughter is not always the best medicine, and sometimes, it can actually be harmful.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, in that case I definitely won't be laughing at your jokes any more! And, to be honest, it wasn't funny anyway.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nAnyway, today we'll be exploring the connection between laughter and health, and looking at some health-related vocabulary. But before we get into the story, Neil: a question. You're a parent. At what age do babies begin to laugh? Is it:\na) 0-3 months\nb) 3-6 months\nc) 6-8 months\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nRight I'm pretty sure, unless my memory is very bad, that it's a) 0-3 months.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nOK, well, we will find out if you're right at the end of the programme. OK, so laughter, as I said, is generally thought of as a good thing. There's a phrase I said earlier which is:\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">laughter is the best medicine</strong>\n.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nYes, and talking of medicine, there are many medical studies which examine the benefits of laughter - it reduces stress, it's good for your heart, things like that. But now you're telling me it can have some negative effects?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWell, why don't we listen to Professor Robin Ferner, who is one of the authors of the research paper. How many negative effects of laughter does he mention?\n<strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\n<strong>Robin Ferner, University of Birmingham<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWe found people with heart rhythm disturbance which had stopped their heart, we found people who had fainted, we found people whose gullets had burst, we found people who'd dislocated their jaws or burst their lungs.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nQuite a few! It seems laughing can be\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> no laughing matter!</strong>\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> </strong>\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nIndeed - he mentions five problems caused by laughter, including heart rhythm disturbance, fainting, burst gullets, dislocated jaws and even burst lungs.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nSome of those sound quite nasty.\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> Fainting</strong>\nis when you lose consciousness and pass out; and your\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> gullet</strong>\nis the tube through which food passes from the mouth to the stomach, so a burst gullet would be horrible.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nI think it would be very bad! We also heard about burst\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">lungs</strong>\n- lungs are the organs in your chest that you use to breathe. And - I think you'd have to be laughing really hard to do this - to get a\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">dislocated jaw</strong>\n. To dislocate something is to move it out of its normal place or position, so you dis-locate it. A dislocated jaw - ouch.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, thankfully there is no danger of dislocated jaws with your jokes Finn!\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nOK! Well, in fact, these five dangers are only some that were mentioned in the study.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nBut surely, there must have been some positive findings?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYes, let's listen to Professor Robin Ferner again - which health benefit does he mention?\n<strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\n<strong>Robin Ferner, University of Birmingham<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYou actually use energy when you laugh, you move your diaphragm, you expand your lungs, and both those things can be helpful. For example, it's said that laughing for quarter of an hour will burn up 40 kcal, and if you laughed all day you'd use up about 2,000 calories.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nThat's more like it! Laughing can help you lose weight, because you use energy when you laugh.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nIn fact, quite a lot of energy: if you laughed all day you'd use 2,000 calories, which is what most people consume in a day.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nHe also thinks laughing makes people feel better, and it can reduce the chance of having a\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">heart attack</strong>\n.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nSo overall - what's the story - laughing: good or bad?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWell, he says for most people, most of the time, laughing is a great thing. And well, that's good, because I like to laugh, don't you Neil?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nOh yes I do.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nEarlier I asked you Neil, at what age do babies begin to laugh? Was it 0-3 months, 3-6 months or 6-8 months?\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd I said 0-3 months.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWell, Neil, the answer was in fact b) 3-6 months. A little bit later! And 0-3 months, which was your answer, Neil, is when babies smile for the first time.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nWell, you\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">had the last laugh</strong>\nthere Finn.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nVery good - and if you have the last laugh it means you're successful in the end. Right, that's it for this programme. Do log on to bbclearningenglish.com for more 6 Minute English. Goodbye!\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nBye."

Hang on; just let me comb my hair a bit.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nFinn, Finn, Finn, you look fine. Don't worry about it.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nThis isn't quite right. I just want to... have you got a mirror?\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Rob<br/></strong>\nNo I haven't. Just hold it there, OK? Hold it there (he takes a picture). Nice.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nOK, let's have a look.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nRight. I'm gonna save that now... OK, that's it: it's gone to the\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">cloud</strong>\n!\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nReally?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes. we'll be able to look at that later on my laptop.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nAh, the cloud! You don't mean the one in the sky, of course.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nNo.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYou mean the huge computers where companies like Apple, Facebook and Google store their users' pictures, videos and documents. You know, I'm a little suspicious about the cloud.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAre you?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWell, I just don't want lots of people looking at that picture. Mainly because my hair doesn't look quite right.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYou're so vain. Gosh! It's too late now. But you look fine so you can share it with the world.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nOK.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThink about those poor celebrities who've had their nude pictures\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">leaked</strong>\nonline.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nLeaked - now this refers to pictures that were being kept hidden being made available to the public. They were leaked to the public. Actress Jennifer Lawrence, who starred in the\n<em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Hunger Games </em>\nmovies, was one as was the singer Rhianna.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThis incident has made people discuss the issue of\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">privacy</strong>\non the internet. Privacy means being free from public attention. And in this programme you'll hear useful words for giving your opinion on this subject.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYes. The celebrities were very angry.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThey thought they could keep their pictures private because they were in the cloud protected by a\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">password </strong>\n- a word or sequence of numbers that only they knew and which is required for them to gain access to what is stored in their name.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nThe US federal police - that's the FBI - have been investigating this to find the\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">hackers</strong>\ninvolved. Hackers are people who understand a lot about computers and use flaws - or little problems - in the software to gain access to a computer file, or network, illegally.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nToday we have passwords for everything. And we have so many devices - like smartphones and laptops and computers - so I'm going to ask you a question about smartphones.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nOK. Very good.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAccording to research, how many people had mobile phones in 2013? Was it:\na) 1.4 million people\nb) 14 million people\nc) 1.4 billion people\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nAcross the whole world?\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYup.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nI think this is got to be: c) 1.4 billion people.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, you'll get the correct answer at the end of the programme. Right. Let's talk more about privacy online. People are more and more concerned about it. Listen to the advice internet expert Oliver Crofton gives us. Which word does he use to describe how you have to be when putting things into the cloud?\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> </strong>\n<strong>INSERT<br/></strong>\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Oliver Crofton, expert on the internet<br/></strong>\nI think ultimately it's about being slightly\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">savvy</strong>\non what you put into the cloud. If you have a private or sensitive photograph, or a contract or some sort of document that has public interest and that people will want to try and get, just think twice about putting it into an environment such as a Cloud, of which you don't really have any control over.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nHe says people have to be 'savvy' - now, that means well-informed and quite shrewd, you know, thinking carefully about things. He advises us to be very careful before putting documents and pictures onto these websites owned by big corporations.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes, because he says we don't have any control over their computers - you don't know how secure your documents are.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nYeah, you know Rob, I can see why people are suspicious of these things.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, let's see what the BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones has to say. Rory explains howsome cloud companies are offering to make the cloud more secure. Which word does he use to describe this kind of security process and it also means 'identification of the user'?\n<strong>INSERT<br/></strong>\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent<br/></strong>\nMany cloud companies now offer an added layer of security called 'two-factor\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">authentication</strong>\n', where users have to enter a code sent to their mobile phone as well as a password to get into their accounts.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nOK, the word was 'authentication' - now, that's confirmation that someone is who they say they are. And the company actually uses two steps to do this.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes. After you try to access your account, they send a code - probably a series of numbers - to your mobile phone, so it's an extra bit of information that only you know.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWe really all should be very careful about how we protect our computers, and our tablets and our smartphones, things like that.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nTalking about smartphones, let's go back to my question.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nOK.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nI asked you how many people had mobile phones in 2013. Was it: 1.4 million people, 14 million people, or 1.4 billion people?\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nAnd I said 1.4 billion - the big one.\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd you are correct!\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nOK!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nYes, by the end of 2013, about 1.4 billion people owned and used smartphones and by the end of 2014 this number will increase by 25% - this is according to the research company eMarketer.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nWow! What a lot of phones, Rob!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nIndeed. Well, our time is up so let's remember some of the words we've explained today.\n<strong>Finn<br/></strong>\nThey were:\n<strong>cloud</strong>\n<strong>leak</strong>\n<strong>privacy</strong>\n<strong>password</strong>\n<strong>hackers</strong>\n<strong>savvy</strong>\n<strong>authentication</strong>\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThat's it for today.

I'm Finn, and Rob's here too.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, hello.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nHi. Rob - tell me - do you have a spare room in your house?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAbsolutely not. We're full to capacity in our house.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnd what about a\n<strong>driveway</strong>\nfor your car?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nA driveway - so you mean a parking space off the road at my house? Not exactly a driveway, but yes I do have a parking space, yes.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell - both of these are ways of making money in the 'sharing economy'. Interested? Well, we'll be talking about this new economy in the programme, and learning some language related to making money. But first - a question.\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nGreat. I don't have to pay for it do I?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nIt's a free question. But no prize either. In February 2014, Britain's most expensive parking space went on sale, but for how much? Was it:\na) £80,000\nb) £100,000\nc) £400,000\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell, it's just a parking space isn't it? So I'm going to go for the lowest value: £80,000.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\n£80,000 - still a lot of money. We'll find out if that's the right answer at the end of the programme. But first, let's find out a bit more about this sharing economy. Rob, are you\n<strong>feeling the pinch</strong>\n?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nFeeling the pinch - you mean feeling poor. Yes, I'm always feeling the pinch. So come on Finn, tell us how we can make some money.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell, perhaps the best-known example of a company in the sharing economy is Airbnb - it's an American web business which allows you to rent out your spare room to\n<strong>holidaymakers</strong>\n.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nOK. Holidaymakers - so these are people on holiday. Using your spare room as a B and B - that's a bed and breakfast?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes - you can provide breakfast for your guests too...\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThat sounds like a clever way to\n<strong>make a few pennies</strong>\n.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, to make a few pennies - to make a bit of extra money.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nOK well, Airbnb say they operate in 34,000 cities and have 800,000 listings of rooms and apartments. In fact, we could say they're the\n<strong>market-leader </strong>\nin this industry - the main, most successful company.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThere are many companies doing very similar things. And one doing something with parking spaces is JustPark. It's a British business that lets you rent out your driveway or parking space.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnother way to make money\n<strong>on the side</strong>\n- which means to make some extra money in addition to your normal job. We're going to hear from the founder of JustPark now, Anthony Eskinazi. Where did the idea for the business come from?\n<strong>Anthony Eskinazi, founder of JustPark<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWhen I had the original idea, I spotted a driveway close to a sports stadium. It would have been so convenient if I could have just parked in that driveway rather than in a\n<strong>commercial </strong>\ncar park.\n<em> </em>\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nSo, Anthony said that he got the idea when trying to park near a stadium. He said he saw a driveway. He thought it would be more convenient to just park there than in a commercial car park - a normal one which makes money.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nSo he set up this site. And around 20,000 people have put their spaces on the site, and he says around half a million drivers use it.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nInterestingly, a church near Kings Cross in central London has apparently made over £200,000 by renting out space in its yard to travellers!\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnd of course there are other sites doing very similar things, like Uber and Lyft - these let drivers share their cars with other passengers.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnd there's even a company in Hong Kong which lets you share space under your umbrella when it rains!\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThat sounds like\n<strong>one for a rainy day</strong>\n.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nHaha - an idea to store away until you need it. But I do have a question. What about the people who run things like traditional B and Bs, or commercial car parks - or taxi services - things like that? Won't they be\n<strong>out of pocket</strong>\n?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nOut of pocket, yes - lose money. Many of them are out of pocket and are not happy about this. And there is another issue:\n<strong>regulations</strong>\n- or laws. Listen to the editor of\n<em>Tech City News</em>\n, Alex Wood. Why are regulations for these new businesses unclear?\n<strong>Alex Wood, editor of Tech City News<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nTake the example of someone who has a driveway in their house. They've got some spare capacity there - they're looking to make some more money. But how does that affect their neighbours? How does that affect the Council and the regulation and the rules around them? Because this is a new business world, those rules aren't there yet.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell, he says they're unclear - because the rules aren't there yet. Because it's a whole new business world.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nIn fact, Airbnb has had problems with the law. But, in a time when the economy is doing badly, these businesses seem to be\n<strong>thriving</strong>\n- doing really well - and provide an extra\n<strong>source of income</strong>\nfor many people.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThat's right. Many are benefitting from this new economy. But others are out of pocket. That's business. Rob, what about us? Could you make some money from this sharing economy? You could rent out your bike - your lovely folding bike - while you're at work?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThat's a really good idea - it's kind of a downtime, the bike's not being used, so why not! Anyway - how about the answer to today's question?\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, earlier I asked you about the most expensive parking space ever to go on sale in London. How much was it on sale for?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell, I had a guess and I said £80,000.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell, you were completely wrong. It was the most expensive one: £400,000.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nNo way! For a parking space!\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nIt was a space in London, in Kensington and it went on sale for £400,000, which is over twice the price of the average UK house. So very expensive! Anyway, Rob, before we go any further, how about those words again?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nOK, the words we've heard today were:\ndriveway\nfeeling the pinch\nholidaymakers\nmake a few pennies\non the side\nmarket leader\none for a rainy day\nout of pocket\nregulations\nthriving\nsource of income\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThank you Rob.

Rob's here today. Hi Rob.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nHello Finn – are you well?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nVery well, thanks. Rob, tell me – do you have a favourite\n<strong>science-fiction</strong>\nmovie?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAhh, science fiction – stories about an imagined future … well my favourite was and always will be\n<em>ET: Extra Terrestrial</em>\n, and you Finn?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nMine would probably be\n<em>Blade Runner</em>\n– the movie with Harrison Ford set in a dark, scary Los Angeles where he hunts robots called replicants. You know the one?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI do – and come to think of it, lots of movies and stories about the future are quite dark and negative …\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nBut perhaps this might change. A new project wants to use the power of science fiction to do something very different: to inspire people to create a better future. It sounds very grand. We'll be discussing the project and learning some language to talk about the future in this programme.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nBut before we get\n<em>too</em>\nfar into the future, I'm sure you have a question for me, Finn?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes indeed. It's about the film\n<em>Blade Runner</em>\n. It's set in the future – but in which year?\na)    2000\nb)    2019\nc)    2056\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI think I'm gonna go for the far future, c) 2056.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell I'll tell you if you're right or wrong later\n<strong>in the not-too-distant future</strong>\n.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nVery good. So, as we were saying: lots of science fiction is negative.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, there's a word to describe the kind of future world which often appears in science fiction:\n<strong>dystopian</strong>\n. The noun 'dystopia' means an imagined place where things are unpleasant or bad. The opposite is\n<strong>utopia</strong>\nand\n<strong>utopian</strong>\n.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nBut why is so much science fiction dystopian? Dr Braden Allenby from Arizona State University.\n<strong>Braden Allenby, Professor of Engineering and Ethics, Arizona State University</strong>\nThe\n<strong>downside</strong>\nof both of science fiction and movies is that they tend to be dystopian, they tend to be very negative, they tend to be very noir. Dystopian is easier to do. It's easier to write a dystopian story than it is to write an optimistic story.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nHe says dystopian stories are easier to write. I can see that – there's more conflict in a world which has problems – and good stories often have a lot of conflict and problems to resolve.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, but Braden thinks being negative is the downside of science fiction. A downside is a disadvantage, a bad point. He would prefer to see more\n<strong>optimistic</strong>\nscience fiction.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nOptimistic, more positive about the future, which is why Braden is taking part in something called Project Hieroglyph. It brings together writers, scientists, engineers and artists to create optimistic stories about things which really could happen in the next 50 years.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nSo let's talk about the kinds of things are happening in these stories?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell, there's one about a huge tower 20 km tall – going all the way into space. Apparently, building the tower is good for the US steel industry … and they invent a new kind of energy in the story too.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nSounds very interesting – but is it\n<strong>plausible</strong>\n– could it really happen? Could they really build a tower that big?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell, there's another about\n<strong>environmentalists</strong>\nwho fight to stop people building the first hotel in Antarctica.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nEnvironmentalists – people who care about the environment. Well there's conflict there … and it's plausible, so it could be a good story. But I can't help thinking – will these stories actually change anything?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nEd Finn, who edited a book of these stories, thinks so. He says: \"A good science-fiction story can be very powerful\". \"It can inspire hundreds, thousands, millions of people to\n<strong>rally around</strong>\nsomething that they want to do.\"\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nTo rally around something means to come together in support of a cause.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnd Braden Allenby says you can already see the influence of science fiction in modern research. Which item is being worked on right now?\n<strong>Braden Allenby, Professor of Engineering and Ethics, Arizona State University</strong>\n\"Why are people working on, for example, invisibility cloaks? Well, it's Harry Potter, right? That's where they saw it.\"\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAn invisibility cloak – a long coat which makes you\n<strong>invisible,</strong>\nin other words unable to be seen – which people first saw in one of the\n<em>Harry Potter</em>\nmovies.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nInteresting … so will the stories from Project Hieroglyph inspire people to do and invent new things that can help others? Can they help create\n<strong>a</strong>\n<strong>bright future</strong>\n– that's a good, positive future? Or will they just be good stories?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\n<strong>Time will tell</strong>\n– that means we'll find out as time goes by. One thing that we're going to find out right now is the answer to when the movie\n<em>Blade Runner</em>\nwas set?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI said the answer was c) 2056.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnd the answer was in fact b) 2019. A little bit earlier, Rob.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nQuite soon, then?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, it's in a couple of years. So, watch out LA. But, Rob, can you remind us of some of the words we learned today?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWe had …\nscience fiction\ndystopian\ndownside\noptimistic\nplausible\na bright future\ntime will tell\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnd that's it for today's programme.

I'm Rob …\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\n… and hello, I'm Finn.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nNow Finn, there is nothing I like more than\n<strong>tucking into</strong>\na juicy steak, munching on a hamburger or chewing on a nice piece of roast beef.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nIt does sound good, doesn't it? But meat eaters, like us, might need to think again about the amount we eat.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThat's right because in the programme today we're discussing how eating meat can add to the problem of\n<strong>greenhouse gas</strong>\n.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nGreenhouse gas is a type of gas that stops heat escaping from the atmosphere and causes a greenhouse effect – it warms up our planet – and that leads to climate change.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, that's it's not a good thing. We have heard in the past about greenhouse gas being caused by pollution from factories…\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\n… and from using containers of things like paint or perfume, which is kept under high pressure so that it can be sprayed – we call these aerosols.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nBut according to a recent report, the production of meat is also adding to the problem. We'll talk more about this soon and looking at some related vocabulary, but not before we've set today's question. Are you ready, Finn?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nReady and waiting, Rob.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAccording to a study in America, how many tonnes of beef is produced globally every year?\na)    59 million tonnes\nb)    69 million tonnes\nc)    79 million tonnes\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nLet's go supersize and say 79 million tonnes.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI'll let you know the answer at the end of the programme. Let's continue our discussion about the link between meat and greenhouse gases.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nResearch from Cambridge and Aberdeen universities estimates greenhouse gases from food production will go up 80% if meat and dairy\n<strong>consumption</strong>\ncontinues to rise at its current rate. 'Consumption' here means the process of eating food.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nSo more and more of us are eating meat – there is a surge. Let's find out exactly why from BBC Environment Analyst, Roger Harrabin. See if you can hear why meat production is causing the problem …\n<strong>INSERT<br/>BBC Environment Analyst, Roger Harrabin<br/></strong>\nThe surge in meat eating will drive more deforestation as farmers seek increasing amounts of land, the study says. Cutting forests releases greenhouse gases from the wood and the soil, and fertilisers create greenhouse gases too. The report says under current trends, agriculture alone will cause the world to bust its targets for reducing the risk of dangerous climate change.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nSo eating more meat means farmers need more land to keep their animals on. And to get more land, they need to cut down trees – which is called\n<strong>deforestation</strong>\n.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nIt's deforestation – cutting down forests – that causes greenhouse gases from wood and soil to be released. And there's another reason too – the use of\n<strong>fertilisers</strong>\n.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThese are natural or chemical substances added to the soil to help plants grow. Like these plants, used to feed the animals.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnd another problem is that more of the fields used for growing crops that we eat, like wheat, are being used to grow food to feed the animals that we later eat!\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nResearch has also found beef cattle need 28 times more land than pork, poultry or dairy farming.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nSo it's a big problem, but many of us have an\n<strong>appetite</strong>\n– a need or interest – for meat. Especially for\n<strong>carnivores. </strong>\nCarnivores are really animals that just eat meat but we refer to humans as carnivores too sometimes because they just love meat. Something else is tempting us too.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, something is encouraging us to eat more. See if you can hear what it is in the next part of Roger Harribin's report…\n<strong>INSERT<br/>BBC Environment Analyst, Roger Harrabin<br/></strong>\nThe real challenge is the public's appetite. There's a burger restaurant boom in major cities. People are voting with their bellies and it's not normally mushroom burgers they're after!\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nSome interesting language there. He described the increase in burger restaurants as a\n<strong> 'boom'</strong>\n– so a major increase. And he said people are voting with their bellies …\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nA nice phrase – he means, people are showing they like burger restaurants by going to them and eating more.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnd they're not buying burgers made of vegetables or things like mushroom burgers – they're buying and eating meat, like beef burgers.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell, with meat consumption predicted to double in the next 40 years as people globally get wealthier, it's a problem that's not going to go away.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nA bit like today's question – today's question was, according to a scientific study in America, how many tonnes of beef is produced globally every year?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI said c) 79 million tonnes.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThat's a lot to eat but you are wrong. The answer is 59 million tonnes. This is according to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It also found cattle are the biggest source of greenhouse gases, accounting for more than three-quarters of all gases made by farming livestock around the world. Well before we chew over that fact, Finn could you please remind us of some of the words we have heard today?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nOk:\ntucking into\ngreenhouse gas\nconsumption\ndeforestation\nfertiliser\nappetite\ncarnivore\nboom\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell, that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Rob... and... is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's Super-Finn!\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nHello Rob - it's just Finn here actually - I'm no\n<strong>superhero</strong>\n!\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThat's a shame. So you don't have any special\n<strong>superpowers </strong>\n- amazing skills and abilities that can be used for saving people and fighting against evil?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell, lots of powers, but no superpowers. I'm afraid not. Superheroes, of course, tend to be\n<strong>fictional</strong>\ncharacters – they're made-up characters, who appear in comics and books and movies.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYou mean characters like Batman, Spiderman and Wonder Woman. Do you have a favourite?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI do actually. Spiderman was my favourite when I was growing up. And he can climb up walls and I really wanted to do the same - I tried to climb up the walls in my house and sadly I failed because superheroes are fictional - they aren't real!\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell some real-life superheroes do exist and that's what we'll be talking about today and we'll be explaining some words related to superheroes. But first a question...\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nCan I use my superpowers to answer this one?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYou can try. What year did Superman first appear published in a comic book?\na)    1930\nb)    1934\nc)    1938\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nMy\n<em>spidey</em>\nsense tells me it's 1934.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI'll tell you if you're right or wrong at the end of the programme. Now let's find out more about some real-life superheroes. These are people who don't really have superpowers but they are doing something\n<strong>extraordinary</strong>\n.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nSo they are doing something special - but most importantly, they are doing something good.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nPeople often describe someone who has done something brave, such as saving someone's life, as a hero. Firefighters are sometimes described as heroes because they often risk their lives to save others.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nBut heroes don't have to be\n<strong>life-savers</strong>\n. We sometimes describe a person with great intelligence or amazing abilities as 'our hero' - a musician maybe or an athlete. It's someone we\n<strong>admire</strong>\nand look up to.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell there's a man in Japan who's recently been described as a 'superhero'. To be honest, I don't think his powers are superhuman - that means a power that ordinary humans don't have - but what he does is rather unusual and he gives up his free time doing it.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nTell me more Rob.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThis is Chibatman - named after the city of Chiba where he comes from. His\n<strong>mission</strong>\n- his purpose - is to make the people of the city happy.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThat's a worthwhile mission.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nIt is. Chibatman has been spotted 'flying' through the streets of Chiba dressed a bit like Batman and riding his custom-built three-wheeled Chibatpod. But why? Is he just a bit crazy or does he have\n<strong>honourable</strong>\nintentions?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYou mean does he genuinely want to do good things and make things better?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell, listen to what he says, speaking through a translator, and see if you can hear what his reasons are …\n<strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\"/>'Chibatman' - Chiba superhero<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI started doing this around three years ago. As for my reasons: during the great earthquake people forgot how to smile. I wanted to help bring the smile back and that's why I started.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nOK, so because of the devastation caused by the earthquake and tsunami in 2011, he felt people had forgotten how to smile. So his mission was to get people smiling again. That's something we could describe as being 'honourable'.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWhat is interesting about him and other superheroes is they keep their identity\n<strong>closely-guarded</strong>\n- nobody knows who the real man in the costume is.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThat's also true for another Japanese man who's been called a superhero. Mr Full Moon wears a costume to hide his identity when he goes around cleaning the streets of Tokyo.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, he actually talks to people through a voice on his smartphone. He hasn't been employed by anyone to do this ­- he just claims he wants to keep the city's streets cleaner. We could call him a grime fighter armed with a dustpan and brush!\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nVery good - a 'grime fighter' - someone fighting dirt and dust!\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnyway, time now to see if your superpowers helped you answer today's question correctly.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes Rob, you asked me what year Superman first appeared in a comic book.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnd you said 1934 and you were wrong. Superman first appeared in Action Comics #1 in June 1938. The character was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster and originally he wasn't a hero but a villain - the bad guy - but he was changed into a hero before he was published in the comic.\nNow before you change into your costume, could you save the day by reminding us of some of the words we have heard today?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, today we heard:\nsuperhero\nsuperpowers\nfictional\nextraordinary\nlife-savers\nadmire\nmission\nhonourable\nclosely-guarded\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell, that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English. We hope you've enjoyed today’s programme. Please join us again soon. Bye.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nBye."

Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm joined today by Finn.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nHello.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nToday we are going to talk about electronic cigarettes – also called e-cigarettes – and teach you words that will help you to discuss the subject or understand news about it.Do you smoke, Finn?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nNo. And sometimes the smoke from other people's cigarettes makes me\n<strong>cough</strong>\n(coughs a bit). Just thinking about it makes me want to cough (coughs again).\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nIt's because you are a\n<strong>secondary smoker</strong>\n– in other words, you're someone who doesn't smoke but breathes in the smoke from someone else's cigarette. And this smoke is very harmful to your health. So, here is today's question, Finn.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nOK, go ahead.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, there are more than 4,000 chemicals in cigarette smoke. How many of these are known to be harmful to our health? Is it at least:\na)    50\nb)    150\nc)    250\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nMm … Let me think. (he guesses)?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYou'll get the answer at the end of the programme. Well, electronic cigarettes are everywhere now. Some estimates say more than a million people are using e-cigarettes just in the UK. But these devices might not be very safe for secondary smokers …\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nIs that so? I thought they were okay because they produce vapour rather than the smoke full of harmful chemicals you get in ordinary cigarettes.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell, the World Health Organisation is not convinced e-cigarettes are any safer to secondary smokers. It has recommended a\n<strong>ban</strong>\non the use of electronic cigarettes indoors and their sale to people under 18 years old.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nA ban? In other words, they don't want them to be permitted indoors anymore? I know that e-cigarettes work by heating liquid\n<strong>nicotine</strong>\n– this is the substance in tobacco which makes it addictive. It turns into vapour which is inhaled by the smoker. I thought because it was just vapour, it was okay for non-smokers!\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nIt's vapour with some chemicals in it. And experts fear it could have similar effects to the smoke produced by ordinary cigarettes. Listen to what Professor John Ashton has to say. He's from the Faculty of Public Health here in the UK. Which words does he use to describe the use of e-cigarettes for an extended period of time?\n<strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\">Professor John Ashton, from the Faculty of Public Health in the UK<br clear=\"none\"/></br></strong>\nThere are scientists in America who've been studying second-hand effects of tobacco smoke who are raising these issues now about the e-cigarettes. And we really can't allow these things to get establishedbefore we know what the\n<strong>long-term </strong>\neffects are going to be.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nHe talks aboutlong-termeffects. He means that the constant use of e-cigarettes for an extended period of time might cause harm which we are not aware of yet.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYou can't light up a cigarette in a pub or bar anymore. It was the effect of people's cigarette smoke on other staff that led to the ban on ordinary cigarettes in Britain. Private companies and the authorities are keen not to risk bringing back any kind of smoking to closed spaces in public places.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThis is likely to annoymany smokers who have been moving to electronic cigarettes in an attempt to cut down on nicotine or even\n<strong>quit smoking</strong>\n.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, many people want to quit smoking ­ – stop smoking – at once. And they find it easier to do this if they can use e-cigarettes. In the last few decades smokers have been feeling persecuted.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, there's a lot of pressure for them to quit the habit.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nListen to what this smoker who uses e-cigarettes has to say.He's in a pub in Bristol. Which word does he use to talk about the harm certain things do to children?\n<strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\">Male customer, Bristol pub<br clear=\"none\"/></br></strong>\nWe react at absolutely everything in this world. What we'll gonna have eventually though is 'no drinking beer' in pubs because it's\n<strong>damaging </strong>\nfor children to watch it happening.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nHe uses the word 'damaging', meaning harmful. He complains that there's an\n<strong>overreaction</strong>\nto things like cigarettes and alcohol.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes. An 'overreaction' means responding to something in a way which is more forceful than required. He complained that one day the authorities might end up banning people from drinking alcohol in pubs. Pubs, as we know, are bars to which most customers go to drink alcohol.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nHe is using some irony here.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes. The right to smoke or not smoke generates passionate debates. Smoking is bad for your health, but some people argue that eating junk food is bad too but it's still available all over the place.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nCigarettes are addictive and it's very difficult for people just to give them up.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nBut here are some facts which might make people think again. I told you earlier in the programme that there are more than 4,000 chemicals in cigarette smoke. And I asked you how many of these are known to be harmful to health. The options were: at least 50, 150 or 250?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI said 250. Is it as many as that, Rob?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nIt is as many as that.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWow!\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, at least 250. Acording to the World Health Organisation website, it says that more than 50 chemicals in tobacco smoke are known to cause cancer. Any amount of second hand tobaco smoke is thought to be unsafe, and second hand smoke causes more that 600,000 early deaths per year. Well, as we are nearly the end of the programme, let's just remember some of the words we used today. Finn?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWe heard:\ncough\nsecondary smoker\nban\nnicotine\nlong-term\nquit smoking\ndamaging\noverreaction\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThanks Finn. Well that's it for this programme.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm joined today by Neil.\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nHello. Neil here. Excuse me I'm enjoying a bar of chocolate…\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWhere did you get that from?\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nIn the\n<strong>vending machine</strong>\nupstairs – that's the automatic machine with drinks and sweets – you put coins in it to release whatever you paid for.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nNow, if it was up to some health professionals, you wouldn't see many of those machines around anymore.\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWhat? No more machines which offer you as many sweets as you like, no questions asked?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nExactly. The World Health Organisation has recently proposed a cut in its recommendation for how much sugar we should have. They now say that it should be less than 5% of our\n<strong> calorie intake</strong>\n.\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nA\n<strong> calorie </strong>\nis a unit that measures how much energy you get from food, and calorie intake is how many calories we eat in a period of time – say a day, for example.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes. So this might be it for sugar for you today, Neil.\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell, let me see… this bar of chocolate contains 215 calories! That's quite a lot, isn't it?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nBut life can be sweet even with less sugar, Neil. So today, we're going to talk about what should be done to help us eat less sugar and you'll learn words about food.\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nBut I like my sugar!\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nMany people do. So let me ask you about how much they like it. Which country has the highest sugar consumption? Is it:\na)    China\nb)    India\nc)    The United States\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI think it's the United States.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nOkay. Well, we'll have the answer at the end of the programme! Right, so let's talk about sugar. Health experts are looking for ways to make us eat less of it.\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWe all know that too much sugar can cause not only obesity and diabetes but also\n<strong>tooth decay</strong>\n– this destroys the hard surface of your teeth and exposes more sensitive parts. Ouch!\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, it can be very painful. You might enjoy eating sweets but nobody likes\n<strong>toothache</strong>\n– that's what we call the pain in your teeth.\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nExperts say we should always brush our teeth after eating sugary food.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes. Aubrey Sheiham, Professor of Dental Public Health at University College London, goes even further. He is part of a team which is suggesting the authorities in England reduce the number of vending machines in public places. Listen to what he says. Which word does he use to describe Neil's chocolate bar and other kinds of wrapped sweets?\n<strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\"/>Aubrey Sheiham, Professor of Dental Public Health at University College London<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWe shouldn't have vending machines with\n<strong>confectionery </strong>\nand\n<strong>soft drinks</strong>\nin any publicly-funded institutions – no schools, nurseries, hospitals etc. – and also limit the amount of sugar in school meals, nurseries' meals. That again would be a first step that one would take.\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nHe mentions 'confectionery', meaning chocolate and sweet snacks, which can be bought from vending machines, along with soft drinks – which are cold sweet drinks that are not alcoholic.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThe professor doesn't want these machines in state schools or hospitals. And he also wants meals served to children in schools to have less sugar.\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nHe's got a point there. We get used to sugar in childhood. And it seems that the more sugar we eat, the more we want. But if we get used to eating things which are less sweet, after a while when we eat something very sweet, it doesn't taste so good. Do you understand what I mean?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, I do. It's a matter of habit. We don't need so much sugar to enjoy the sweet taste. But the professor says there's another way of encouraging us to eat less sugar. Aubrey Sheiham talks about tax on sugar. France has already adopted a sugar tax. Where's the money being spent? Let's listen.\n<strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\n<strong>Aubrey Sheiham, Professor of Dental Public Health at University College London<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYou've got a lot of public support in France where the consumption of sugar has gone down considerably. And, what is good about what the French have done is that tax that has gone on sugar is being spent in the\n<strong>health service</strong>\n. This is a way that you could actually use that money from the sugar tax and spend it on improving health care and dental care.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nHe says it's being spent on the health service. This is the doctors' surgeries and hospitals financed with public money – money paid to a government in the form of taxes.\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nOh, so chocolate might become more expensive! Not so good for me because I\n<strong>have a sweet tooth</strong>\n…\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAh a sweet tooth, yeah, like me – a strong preference for sweet food. Well, people with a sweet tooth should be careful or they might end up with toothache.\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI care a lot about my teeth.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nGood on you. You've got a fine set of gnashers there. Okay, let's go back to our quiz. I asked you which country has the highest sugar consumption. The options were: China, India and the United States.\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnd I said the United States.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnd Neil, you are wrong. The correct answer is actually India. According to a report issued by the US Department of Agriculture in 2012, India was the country with the highest consumption of sugar. Then we had China and the country in this list which ate the least amount of sugar is the United States.  These countries are also amongst the largest producers of sugar. Okay. Well, now our time is up. Let's remember some of the words we explained today.\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes. They were:\nvending machine\ncalorie intake\ncalorie\ntooth decay\ntoothache\nconfectionery\nsoft drinks\nhealth service\nto have a sweet tooth\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThanks, Neil. That is it for today. Why not go to bbclearningenglish.com to hear more 6 Minute English. Bye for now!\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nBye!"

Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm joined today by Finn. Hi Finn.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nHello Rob.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nToday we're talking about something we have some\n<strong>expertise</strong>\nin or knowledge about. That's teaching English.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThat's right Rob. We work on the BBC's Learning English website - hopefully giving people around the world\n<strong>a helping hand</strong>\nin learning a language that isn't the one they usually use.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell hopefully we're about to make that learning journey a bit easier as we launch a brand new online course. But how long does it take someone to become a\n<strong>fluent</strong>\nspeaker of English?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nA good question Rob and one we'll try to answer today. We'll also be discussing some general ways to make learning English easier and explaining some learning-related vocabulary along the way. So let's get started Rob.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nHold your horses Finn – not so fast! I have a question to ask you first. According the last UK census taken in 2011, what percentage of the British population speaks a first language that is not English?\na)    1.7%\nb)    7.7%\nc)    14.7%\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThat's an interesting one. My first guess is c) 14.7%.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWe'll find out if you are right or wrong later. So now we can discuss how learning English is getting easier. Of course there are a huge number of publications – books, leaflets and magazines – that can help teach you but there are those people who say that you can't beat the real thing – a teacher. Someone who can explain a language to you\n<strong>face-to-face</strong>\n.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes but that comes at a cost and isn't always practical – you might not have a school nearby. That's why in the 21st Century, online seems to be the main method of learning. Technology is allowing the English language to come to you!\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThat's true and that's why we've launched a brand new English course that's available on a computer, tablet or mobile phone. It's aimed at intermediate learners and charts a\n<strong>pathway</strong>\nthrough the various aspects of the language.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWe hope that by committing around 15 minutes a day to using it, a learner will see a real improvement in their English knowledge and skill. But as well as using the\n<strong>resources </strong>\navailable online, how else can someone help themselves to get a better\n<strong>grasp</strong>\n– a better understanding - of English?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell if someone wants to become a confident speaker of English, trainer Richard Hallows has some tips. Have a listen and see if you can hear what are the two main aspects of English that you need.\n<strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\">Richard Hallows – trainer in speaking English <br clear=\"none\"/></br></strong>\nMost importantly, you've got to have a a good range of vocabulary and grammar. You need to know lots of words, the more words you know the better, obviously. And similarly with grammar, the more grammar you have the better you can explain yourself. We also need to think about pronunciation - learners of English often worry about speaking like a native speaker… it's not necessary to have a native accent.\n<em> </em>\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nOK, so Richard says you need a good range – or a wide variety - of vocabulary and grammar. The more words you know the more you can say – and the more grammar you know, the better you can say it…\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nOr even write it! One other tip is don't try to sound like a\n<strong>native</strong>\n– so someone who speaks English as a first language. All these are things we aim to cover in our new course.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nOur new course might be a big help to you if you need English for your work, or if you're studying in English, or if you're planning to visit or even live in the UK. The British government expects immigrants to reach ESOL Entry 3 or B1 level, before they can be granted citizenship. It's equivalent to being able to hold a reasonably confident basic conversation.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell in the UK it's estimated that you need around 360 hours of study to get to that stage from not knowing any English at all.  But this depends on a number of factors such as\n<strong>motivation</strong>\n– how much you want to learn.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnd age can be a factor. Some experts say it's common for children under the age of 11 to be very immersed and be fluent in English in about six months. But why should someone choose to learn English? This is something we've been asking you on our Facebook page.\n<strong><br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\n<strong>Finn              <br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nOussama says: \"It's like my passport. You need it wherever you go.\"\n<strong>Rob            <br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nSuzuki says: \"It is an international communication tool.\"\n<strong>Finn               <br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nHa thinks it's: \"The key to getting a good job with a high salary.\"\n<strong>Rob               <br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnd Denis says: \"It's the language that opens doors overseas.\" Thanks for all of your messages.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nBut now Rob, I need to know if I got today's question right.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes. I asked you, according the last UK census taken in 2011, what percentage of the British population speaks a first language that is not English?\n<strong>Finn               <br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI said 14.7%.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYou were wrong. The census found 7.7% per cent of people in the UK have a first language that is not English. That's 4.2 million people.\nWell, that's it for today. Don't forget to check our new website at bbclearningenglish.com. Happy learning!\n<strong>Both<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nBye."

I'm Rob…\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\n… and I'm Finn. Hello.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nHello, Finn. Now, you like food don't you?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, I do.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nBut how much of it do you actually throw away?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nProbably too much although I'm trying to get better at that, Rob.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI'm asking you this because many people around the world throw away food that's still good enough to eat – this food waste could feed millions of other people. That's what we're talking about today as well as looking at some related vocabulary.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, food waste is a big problem. We\n<strong>stock up</strong>\n<strong>on</strong>\nfood that we don't really need, and we're often tempted by supermarkets to\n<strong>consume</strong>\n– or to eat – more.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nBefore we talk more about this, let's find out what you know about food waste. So, do you know, according to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation, what percentage of food is actually wasted?\na)\n<strong>  </strong>\n25%\nb)\n<strong>   </strong>\n33%\nc)\n<strong>   </strong>\n50%\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\n50%, I seem to remember that. I might be wrong.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWe'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. But now, here's another figure for you: In Europe, people throw away 100 million tonnes of food every year.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWow, such a waste. Most of this food just ends up rotting in\n<strong>landfill sites</strong>\nand that adds to another problem – it creates greenhouse gases.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nIt does. But the problem isn't just\n<em>us</em>\nthrowing away\n<strong>leftovers </strong>\nin the fridge or cupboard, as we can hear now from BBC reporter Caroline Hepker. What are the other reasons that lead to food being wasted?\n<strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\n<strong>Caroline Hepker, BBC Reporter<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nTypically, supermarkets demand that onions are about two to two-and-a-quarter inches in diameter. This one will get pretty close to it but this one is too small, although it is perfectlyedible. The question is, what happens to it then? Food waste is a huge issue in America – 40% of all food goes uneaten and it's a problem that starts long before you get to the dining-room table.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnother staggering figure there Rob – 40% of all food in America goes uneaten – it doesn't get eaten.And she explained that supermarkets are partly to blame.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes. We all love the\n<strong>convenience</strong>\n, the price and the choice of food that supermarkets offer – but a lot of food is binned – thrown out – long before it reaches the shelves.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThe reporter gave the example of onions: if they're the wrong size, they can't be sold; they're thrown away even though they’re good enough to eat – or\n<strong>edible</strong>\n.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThere are many other types of fruit and vegetables that are\n<strong>discarded</strong>\n– or thrown away – because of their shape and size. And that's our fault really, because we often think food that looks good is better quality.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnother issue is the 'sell by' and 'use by' dates printed on food packaging. They confuse customers. Anything older than the 'sell by' date makes us think it’s old and the food has\n<strong>gone off</strong>\n, but in fact this is just the date supermarket wants to sell it by.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnd there is another reason why some of us are encouraged to buy too much food. Have a listen to working mum, Tara Sherbrooke, about her shopping habits and see if you can hear what the problem is.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAlso, see if you can hear what she does to try and minimise food waste.\n<strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\n<strong>Tara Sherbrooke<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI try very hard to meal-plan because as a working mum and having a busy family, I really try to make sure that there’s enough food at the beginning of the week. I find it very difficult to walk pass two-for-one offers especially on things that we use. I even find it hard to walk past them when they're items I’ve never purchased before – I stop and look!\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nSo she is a busy working mum and she tries to meal-plan – she plans the family's meals for the week and works out what to buy.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nBut she still gets tempted by the two-for-one offers. That's when you buy one item and you get another one of the same item for free.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nBuy-one-get-one-free – or as it's sometimes known,\n<strong>BOGOF</strong>\n! You can get a bargain but it also means we sometimes buy too much of something. If it's fresh produce, it might go off before you get to use it all.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nBut in other parts of the world people struggle to buy even the most basic food. A report by the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation found that there is enough food for everyone, just a lot of inefficiency. So what can be done?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell things are being done. Apps and websites that\n<strong>distribute</strong>\nexcess food are becoming more popular.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnd food banks are being set up too. These are charitable organisations people donate food to. It's then distributed to those who have difficulty buying their own food. And one trial project in New York requires the city's restaurants to stop sending food waste to landfills by 2015. But at the moment, globally, there's still a lot of food being thrown away. And Finn, I asked you how much? Is it 25%, 33% or 50% of all food produced?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI said half – 50%.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAccording to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation, the answer is 33%. Still not good. It also found the amount of land needed to grow all the food wasted in the world each year would be the size of Mexico. Well, that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English. We hope you enjoyed today’s programme. Please join us again soon.\n<strong>Both<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nBye."

Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm joined today by Finn. Hello Finn.\n<strong>Finn  </strong>\n...\n<strong>Rob                 <br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nFinn? …Hello Finn?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nOh sorry Rob, you caught me\n<strong>napping</strong>\n. It's that time of day when I need to\n<strong>nod off</strong>\n– or in other words, fall asleep.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell,\n<strong>sleeping on the job</strong>\n– or sleeping at work - is no bad thing – and I hope today's programme will wake you up to the idea that sleeping in the workplace might be a good thing.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nOh really! That's good to hear. I would have thought that sleeping at work was against the rules.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nNot in every office, Finn, and I'll tell you why soon as well as explaining some sleep-related vocabulary. But now you're wide awake, how about a question?\n<strong>Finn                 <br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nOK, let's hear it.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWhen the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, was in power, she did her job with very little sleep. Do you know how many hours of sleep she is said to have had each night?\na)    Three hours\nb)    Four hours\nc)    Five hours\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI always thought she got by, she managed her job, with just four hours of sleep a night.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nNot much, is it? We'll find out if you are right or wrong later. I'm not sure if she chose\n<em>not</em>\nto sleep for long or she just wasn't able to sleep for long. Someone who can't sleep is called an\n<strong>insomniac</strong>\n.\n<strong>Finn                 <br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnd I'm certainly not an insomniac. I enjoy sleeping all night and some of the day too. And Rob, you said napping during the day is a good thing?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nIt's always nice to have a short sleep – or what I call\n<strong>40 winks</strong>\n– during the day, but when you're at work this can be a problem.  In some companies, like Google and the Huffington Post, workplace naps are positively encouraged. They're seen as a way to make staff more productive.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nSo you mean they work harder and are more creative because a\n<strong>power-nap</strong>\n– a quick sleep – makes workers feel refreshed and more alert. I like the sound of this!\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAn Australian health writer called Thea O'Connor, is a founder of a campaign called Nap Now which is trying to make sleeping at work more acceptable.  She calls herself a '\n<strong>naptivist</strong>\n'! Let's hear from her now. What does she say is stopping us from doing this?\n<strong>Thea O'Connor, health writer and speaker:  <br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI think that our culture is a bit crazy not to embrace it, and one of the reasons we don't is our attitude, you know it's quite counter-cultural to do nothing in order to get ahead. I just really see that it's time to disrupt the prevailing work ethic which is all about work longer and harder.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nRight, so she wants us to embrace – to accept – the idea of a workplace power-nap. But it is our\n<strong>attitude</strong>\n– the way we think about work – that stops society from accepting this.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, she explains that it is\n<strong>counter-cultural</strong>\n– so going against the normal way of thinking – to actually do nothing and have a snooze.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThat's why she is trying to change – or disrupt – our current\n<strong>work ethic</strong>\nof working longer and harder. She believes this doesn't necessarily bring better results. But Rob, is this idea just a fad – something that's popular for a short while?\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nMaybe, but research has certainly shown that good quantity and quality of sleep is important for our\n<strong>wellbeing</strong>\n. A few years ago research by the East of England Development Agency found 30% of people have their best ideas in bed compared to just 11% who have them at their desk. It called for companies to install beds in the workplace.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell, there aren't any in our office yet Rob. I think putting beds or areas for naps in the office would help us workers feel more able to rest and recharge our minds.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAn alternative idea would be to change our working hours. The UK's Sleep Council claims the\n<strong>nine-to-five</strong>\nwork culture does not fit into the natural sleeping pattern of the human race and bosses need to introduce a more sleep-friendly working day.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThat sounds like a\n<strong>siesta</strong>\nto me - a short period of sleep in the middle of the day that people in warm places like Spain often have.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nMy problem with a siesta is that if I have a sleep in the afternoon I'd never wake up!\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell before you nod off now Rob, could you please tell me the answer to today's question.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes. I asked you if you knew how many hours of sleep the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, is said to have had each night?  Three, four or five hours?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI said four hours Rob.\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYou are right. It has often been said she needed just four hours of sleep – only on weekdays, not weekends. Well before you have another power-nap, could you remind us of some of the vocabulary we've heard today:\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, we heard:\nnapping\nnod off\nsleeping on the job\ninsomniac\n40 winks\npower-nap\nnaptivist\nattitude\ncounter-cultural\nwork ethic\nwellbeing\nnine-to-five\nsiesta\n<strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThanks.

But what exactly makes a celebrity?\nNeil and Finn talk about what Canadian singer Justin Bieber has in common with the English poet Lord Byron, born in 1788. And learn some expressions about fame and celebrity.\n<strong>This week's question:</strong>\nThis item of clothing became very famous in the 1980s when Michael Jackson presented his moonwalk to the world...\nHow much was Michael Jackson's leather glove with shiny crystals sold for at auction in 2009?\na) US$ 150,000\nb) US$ 250,000\nc) US$ 350,000\nListen to the programme to find out the answer.\n<strong>celebrity<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nsomeone famous, particularly someone in entertainment or sport\n<strong>show business<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nthe entertainment industry (eg theatre, film, music)\n<strong>talent<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nnatural ability to do something (eg singing, acting)\n<strong>autograph<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\na famous person's signature\n<strong>memorabilia<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nobjects collected by fans because they're connected with the person they admire\n<strong>commodity<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nproduct which is bought and sold\n<strong>image<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nreputation; what other people think about you\n<strong>scandal<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\naction which causes a feeling of shock and disapproval\n<strong>vandalism<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\ndamage to property\nNote: This is not a word for word transcript\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nHello I’m Neil. Welcome to 6 Minute English. And with me here in the studio ladies and gentlemen is … Finn!\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThank you! Thank you sound effects! Thank you, Neil! Is this all for me? I feel like quite a\n<strong>celebrity</strong>\n!\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, a celebrity – someone famous - particularly someone in\n<strong>show business</strong>\n, that's the world of entertainment, theatre and film. Today we're talking about fame, and teaching you some related vocabulary.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes. Some celebrities are famous for their\n<strong> talent</strong>\n, which means by their ability to do something well, like singing, acting or telling jokes …\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnd others are famous for… well, for being famous or being associated with someone who is. The names Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian come to mind: wealthy women with their own TV shows. But, talking about celebrity, let me ask you a question.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nActually Neil, only if you play that lovely applause again.  Go on Neil!\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI knew you would love this. Right. Here it goes.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes! Anyway, Neil... I can give you my\n<strong>autograph</strong>\nlater…\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYou mean signature? An autograph is the signature of a\n<em>famous</em>\nperson, Finn. Fans collect these and things like photographs.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes, we call things like those\n<strong>memorabilia</strong>\n.\n<strong>       <br clear=\"none\"><br clear=\"none\"/></br></strong>\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nFor example, Michael Jackson's leather glove with shiny crystals - it became very famous in the 1980s when he presented his moonwalk to the world. How much was it sold for at auction in 2009? Was it:\na)             US$ 150,000\nb)             US$ 250,000 or\nc)             US$ 350,000\n<strong><br clear=\"none\">Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></br></strong>\nI think Michael Jackson has some big fans in the world so I'll say c) US$ 350,000.\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nOkay. I'll give you the answer at the end of the programme.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nSo the idea of celebrity seems very modern in some ways – does it have a long history?\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell, Lord Byron, a very famous English poet born in 1788, is considered by some experts to be the world's first modern-style celebrity. Let's hear Dr Corin Throsby, English Literature researcher at Cambridge University.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWhy was Byron a celebrity?\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nListen out for the noun she uses in the first sentence meaning a product, or something for sale.\n<strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\n<strong>Dr Corin Throsby, Cambridge University<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nIf we think of celebrity as the moment where someone's personality becomes a\n<strong>commodity</strong>\n. So, for Byron the fact that he was popular on this scale that had never been achieved before because his career had coincided with mass printing. But something more than that, that there was a sort of a secondary industry of Byron stuff, you know, that there were Byron neck ties, people wanted to look like Byron. There was this mass of people that loved him. He could no longer control his\n<strong>image</strong>\n. I think that's what separates celebrity from the fame that had preceded that.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nSo the noun was 'a commodity'. She said that when someone's personality becomes a product, that's when they turn into a celebrity.\n<strong>          </strong>\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nShe talked of fame so big you can't control your own image\n<strong> – </strong>\nthat's your reputation, the way other people think about you and imagine you. Someone interesting in this respect is Justin Bieber.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYeah. Are you a fan, Neil?\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI'm a massive fan of Justin Bieber. I love him.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI believe you.\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nHe's a big name and he's always in the newspapers. His fans are called 'Beliebers'…\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nand Byron's fans were called 'Byron maniacs'. That's the name his wife gave his adoring fans. Though she wasn't too happy about them.\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nYes. Byron's life was full of\n<strong>scandals</strong>\n, actions which cause shock and disapproval among people.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnd for Byron it was mainly his love life. He had affairs with men and women.\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nFor Justin Bieber it's about his behaviour. He was accused of driving after drinking alcohol, and of\n<strong>vandalism</strong>\n.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nVandalism means causing damage to property.\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nPoor Justin Bieber!\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThough he's very popular - his career started when he was in his early teens and I think it must have been difficult growing up with this global fame. Still, I wonder how much his autograph is worth in the current market…\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell,I don't know about Justin Bieber's autograph but I do know about Michael Jackson's shiny glove. It became iconic in the 1980s, but how much was it sold for? Was it US$ 150,000; US$ 250,000 or c) US$ 350,000?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nI said c) US$ 350,000.\n<strong>    </strong>\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nAnd you were right.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWow! That's rare.\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nDid you buy it?\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nIt wasn't me. No.\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWell, our time's up but let's remember the words we heard from today. Finn.\n<strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nWe heard:\ncelebrity\nshow business\ntalent\nautograph\nmemorabilia\ncommodity\nimage\nscandal\nvandalism\n<strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\nThat's it for today.

    "description": "Bored? You're not alone. Everyone from factory workers to pilots experience a feeling of boredom: feeling unhappy and uninterested in what they are doing. Some people get bored because they have nothing to do. But is it always a negative emotion or can it push you to do something different?\nRob and Finn discuss how to deal with boredom and teach some related vocabulary. We promise you won't be bored!\n<strong>This week's question:</strong>\nAccording to the Guinness Book of Records, the longest continuous dramatic performance was held in New Jersey, in the US, in 2010.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm joined today by Finn. Hello Finn.\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nHi Rob. You know, I'm happy you called me to present this programme with you because I was there by my desk feeling a bit bored (yawns loudly).\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nGreat yawn, Finn! A yawn, of course, is that typical reaction of someone who is bored.\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nYeah, it's when you open your mouth wide and take some air in and slowly out.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nOkay. Let's make this a programme all about boredom, shall we? And I'll start by stimulating your imagination.\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nThank you, but how are you going to make me excited and interested in something, Rob?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nHow about I challenge you to a question you might not know the answer to?\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nOkay, well, you can try. Go on then.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nWell, I know you like the theatre.\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nI do. But it has to be an exciting play or I get restless.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nRestless, you mean unable to sit still because you get bored or worried even. Okay. I wonder how you'd feel watching the longest continuous play recorded?\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nThat's quite an offer. What do you mean?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nAccording to the Guinness Book of Records, the longest continuous dramatic performance was held in New Jersey, in the US, in 2010. But do you know how long the cast for The Bald Soprano by Eugene Ionesco, was on stage for? Was it for about:\na) 8 hours\nb) 17 hours\nc) 23 hours\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nWow! They're all pretty long. I'll say b) 17 hours, Rob.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nGoodness! Right. Okay. I'll let you know the answer by the end of the programme. Now, let's talk more about boredom. I think this is a feeling we have to learn how to cope with.\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nYes, we have to learn to deal with this situation successfully – to cope with it. But people often feel they want to change their life, to change their job. They might feel stuck in a rut.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nThat's a good phrase - stuck in a rut. So you mean you've become too fixed in one kind of job?\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nYes. You know Rob, even I sometimes dream of something a bit more exciting like being a professional diver or maybe even a pilot of a really fast plane.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nWell, guess what: even pilots get bored, you know?\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nNot when they are flying anyway.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nWrong. When they're up in the air!\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nNo way! Really? I don't believe you!\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nWell, Missy Cummings, an American, was a fighter pilot. Listen to the phrasal verb she uses meaning to stop being bored, at least for a while. Is there ever time for a fighter pilot to get bored?\n<strong>Missy Cummings, former fighter pilot:</strong>\nOh my gosh, sure, for the same reasons that commercial pilots get bored. These fighter jets are very automated when it comes to just holding altitude and heading. So you turn everything in autopilot and I probably listened to more Oprah Winfrey TV shows on the high-frequency radios… And so you get good about using the technology to figure out how to stave off that boredom.\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nAh, so she listened to a show hosted by the American presenter Oprah Winfrey on the radio to stave off her boredom. Now, to stave off means to stop or to keep an unpleasant feeling away. In this case she means boredom.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nYes, indeed.\nBut some experts think there's something good about feeling bored.\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nReally?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nLet's hear what Tiffany Watt-Smith has to say. She works for the Centre for the History of Emotions at the Queen Mary University of London. Pay attention to the word she uses to describe what boredom does to people.\n<strong>Tiffany Watt-Smith, Queen Mary University of London:</strong>\nOn the one hand people are worried about being under-occupied and bored. On the other there's a set of anxieties about us having any more downtime, you know. We can constantly check our phones at the bus stop. Everything is to be filled and what does that do to our minds? I think boredom is a very useful emotion. It's an emotion which spurs people on to change something about their environment. If you're bored that gives rise to creativity.\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nSo boredom spurs people on to change something. To spur on means to stimulate or to encourage someone to do something.\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nSo what are you going to do, Finn? How will you change your life?\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nChange my life? Okay. Two things. The first one is: I want to know if I got that question right!\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nWell I said at the beginning of the programme that the longest continuous dramatic performance was held in New Jersey, US, in 2010. And I asked you how long was the cast on stage for to play The Bald Soprano by Eugene Ionesco.\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nYes. The options were 8 hours, 17 hours and 23 hours, I think. And I said 17. Was I right?\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nYou were not!\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nOh, no!\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nIt was even longer.\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nWow! 23!\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nAccording to the Guinness Book of Records, the play lasted 23 hours, 33 minutes and 54 seconds. It was achieved by The 27 O'Clock Players who performed The Bald Soprano at Belmar, New Jersey, USA, on 27 July 2010. Anyway Finn, what's the second thing you're going to do to stave off your boredom?\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nYou know what, Rob? I'm going to book myself a fantastic holiday! Maybe I could start with a visit to Patagonia in Argentina to see the penguins…\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nYeah, it sounds very exciting. But before you head off to Patagonia, could you remind us of some of the English words we've heard today?\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nWe heard:\nyawn\nstimulating\nrestless\nto cope with\nstuck in a rut\nto stave off\nto spur on\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nThanks Finn. That's it for this programme. I hope you didn't find it boring.\n<strong>Finn</strong>\nNot at all. I loved it!\n<strong>Rob</strong>\nPlease join us soon again for 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.\n<strong>Both</strong>\nBye.\nAll 6 Minute English programmes pre-September 2014 can be found\n<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/general/sixminute/\" target=\"_self\">here</a>\n."

Is it:\na) 2,000 calories\nb) 2,500 calories\nc) 3,000 calories\nListen to the programme to find out the answer.\nChill and lose weight!\nEnd of Section\nShow All | Hide All\nwhat you do to lose weight and become thinner\nunits that measure how much energy you get from food\nreduce your weight\n(here) people used in a scientific test to find out the effects of something on them\nall the chemical processes in your body, especially those that cause food to be used for energy and growth\n(here) an eating plan that helps someone eat less and lose weight\nperson who is not very active and watches lots of television\nspend the winter sleeping\ntypes of food people eat that make them feel happier when they are sad or worried\n",

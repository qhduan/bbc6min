I'm Rob...</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>...and I'm Neil. Hello.</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Rob                                         <br/></strong>Hello, Neil! You look pleased today, Neil. </span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I am pleased. I just moved into my new flat!    </span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, fantastic! Congratulations! Where is this new flat? </span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's in the city. It's a one-bed flat so it's <strong>bijoux</strong> - meaning small but attractive. There's a balcony, I've got a couple of deckchairs, and a barbecue...</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I can't wait to see it. It sounds perfect. Well, today we're discussing housing - and why in some buildings there are separate entrances for rich and poor residents! So, are you ready for today's quiz question, Neil?</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm all ears.</span>\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">OK, so you mean you're listening carefully.</span>\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">I am.</span>\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Right. What does 'social housing' mean? Is it housing for people who...</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">a) want to buy or rent at a low price?</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">b) want to live together sharing facilities?</span>\nor c) aren't able to pay any rent at all?\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">OK, I think the answer is a) to buy or rent at a low price.</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. Well, we'll see if you were right or wrong later on in the programme. So, have you met your neighbours yet, Neil?</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes - I bumped into one couple as I was leaving for work this morning.</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I see.<strong> Bump into</strong> means to meet somebody by chance. So were they friendly?</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, they complained about me blocking the communal area with my bike - also about my guitar playing. But apart from that, they seemed nice!</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Rob<br/></strong>A <strong>communal area</strong> is an area that is shared by a number of people. Well, I hate to say it, Neil, but your guitar playing is annoying!</span>\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nOh, Rob, genius isn't appreciated here, I think. OK... Let's listen to the journalist Tom Bateman talking about rich and poor doors.\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Tom Bateman, journalist<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">In front of us here is a 20-storey building. Right about me I got tinted blue glass windows and balconies on every floor as you look from the street. And there is a very plush foyer. A sign in the window says 'luxurious penthouses with spectacular views.'</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But this is what the journalist Tom Bateman saw when he went around the other side of the same building.</span>\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Tom Bateman, journalist<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">So as you come down the side of the building, you can see the windows - quite small windows - of the flats above here - certainly no balconies. This is a big grey concrete wall and as you walk down an alleyway towards the other door.</span>\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nSo this building has one entrance with a\n<strong>plush</strong>\n- or expensive and luxurious - foyer. And\n<strong>foyer</strong>\nmeans entrance hall. Then there's another entrance down an\n<strong>alleyway</strong>\n- or narrow passage between buildings.\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">This entrance leads to flats with small windows and no balconies. Why's that, Rob? </span>\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nThat's because the alleyway entrance is the so-called 'poor door'. There' no swanky foyer or tinted glass windows for these residents because they pay less rent than the people living in the apartments at the front.\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Swanky</strong> means something fashionable and expensive that is designed to impress people. And <strong>tinted</strong> glass is coloured glass - so people can't look through your windows.</span>\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">That sounds useful! Do you have tinted glass windows, Neil?</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">No, I don't. Tinted sunglasses are all that I can afford. So what do people think about having a rich door and a poor door for the same building, Rob? </span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Well, some people think it's terrible. They say it's <strong>segregation</strong> - or separation and different treatment of people - and I can't believe the poor-door people put up with it really!</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>To</strong> <strong>put up with something</strong> means to accept something that is annoying without complaining about it. The thing is, though, the poor-door people don't pay nearly as much rent. And they don't have to pay the same service charges that the rich-door people pay.</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">A <strong>service charge </strong>is an amount of money you pay to the owner of an apartment building for things like putting out the rubbish. Well, let's listen to an experience of a poor-door resident. </span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Abdul Mohammed, resident of One Commercial St, City of London<br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">We can't use the lift... because it's for the rich people. So whenever the doors open, I use it. So they try and tell me off for using it. I say, 'here, come, take me to court - I don't mind'. </span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">So what has Abdul been doing that the rich-door residents don't like, Rob?</span>\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nWell, he's been using their lift because it's near his apartment door.\n<strong>Neil<br/></strong>\nAnd what does Abdul mean when he says, 'come, take me to court'?\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">He's inviting the rich-door residents to take legal action against him, but Abdul doesn't really think he's doing anything wrong. </span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, it's time to hear the answer to today's quiz question.</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. What does 'social housing' mean? Is it flats or houses for people... a) who want to buy or rent at a low price? b) who want to live together sharing facilities? or c) who aren't able to pay any rent at all?</span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said a) to buy or rent at a low price.</span>\n<strong>Rob<br/></strong>\nAnd you were right! So well done for that, Neil. Now, shall we listen to the words we've learned on today's programme?\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Good idea. We heard:<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">bijoux<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">bump into<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">communal area<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">plush<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">foyer<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">alleyway<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">swanky<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">tinted<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">segregation<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">to put up with something<br/></span>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">service charge</span>\n<strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Rob<br/></span></strong>\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Thank you. Well, that's the end of today'</span>\ns 6 Minute English. I hope you felt at home with us on today's show! Please join us again soon.\n<span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye.</span>",

  "description": "Would you eat a tomato this colour?\n\nWould you eat a purple tomato? What if it had health benefits? Scientists have developed one that could be on our shop shelves soon.\nThis is the latest example of genetically modified food - food that has been changed from its natural form. There are many reasons for growing GM food, and Rob and Finn discuss some of them in the programme.\nThey also explain some vocabulary related to growing these 'artificial' crops.\nThis week's question:\nWhen was the first genetically modified food first sold commercially? Was it in:\na) 1974\nb) 1984\nc) 1994\nListen to the programme to find out the answer.\nPurple tomatoes\nEnd of Section\nShow All | Hide All\nmade by people, copying something made in nature\nhaving its genetic structure changed for a particular purpose (sometime shortened to GM)\nparts of the DNA in a cell that control the physical development or characteristics of an individual plant or animal\nfight against\ninsects or small animals that damage crops\ndeveloped to be grown on farms\nnatural substance that gives colour\na natural chemical that slows down the decaying process\nimportant or noticeable\nnot expensive\nnot trusting or believing someone or something\nbecoming fully grown or ready for eating\n",

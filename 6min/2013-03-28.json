  "description": "A noisy street scene in Bangkok, Thailand\n\nIn this week's programme, we talk about noise and its opposite: peace and quiet.\nLiving in a city can be a noisy experience. Some people find the sounds comforting, while others move to the countryside to get away from it all. But even those who seek tranquillity can never find complete silence.\nRob and Finn discuss solutions to the problem of noise as well as words and phrases related to the subject.\nThis week's question:\nA new survey in the UK has identified the ten jobs where people are most exposed to noise â€“ noise that can cause serious damage to someone's hearing. Which one of these three jobs has the most exposure to noise?\na) A nightclub worker\nb) A classical musician\nc) An airport ground staff worker\nListen to the programme to find out the answer.\nIs silence golden?\nEnd of Section\nShow All | Hide All\nnoisy mix of loud sounds\nloud, unpleasant noise\nvery loud so nothing else can be heard\nto stop something being heard by making a louder noise\na promise or commitment not to speak for a certain amount of time\na state of peace and calm, without any noise\nmade louder\nreduction in noise\na pleasant sound or something you want to hear\nsaying nothing is better than saying something\n",

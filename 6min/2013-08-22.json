  "description": "\nIn this week's 6 Minute English, Rob and Jennifer talk about why people move around the world to find work. These people are known as global migrants.\nSome 214 million people are international migrants, living in a different country from the one in which they were born. There are plenty with high-level skills who end up working for at least part of their careers outside their home country.\nSome take work they are overqualified for, because it still pays better than what is available at home. This has led to a brain drain from some developing countries.\nFind out what this means as well as some other vocabulary associated with migration.\nThis week's question:\nAccording to figures from the United Nations, which one of these countries has the largest number of immigrants as a percentage of its national population? Is it:\na) United States of America\nb) Qatar\nc) Turkey\nListen to the programme to find out the answer.\nGoing where the work is\nEnd of Section\nShow All | Hide All\nthe movement of people around the world\nleave your home country to permanently live somewhere else\npeople who go to work in another country because there is better work and/or pay\na situation where many highly-skilled people leave a country to go and work somewhere else\nhaving the correct training to do a specific job\nhaving too much training and knowledge for the job you are doing\nan amount of money that is sent to someone\n(in this context) to leave your home and move somewhere else\na stamp in your passport, or piece of official paper, allowing you to work in a country\n(an idiomatic description of) a place where people think they will easily become rich\n",

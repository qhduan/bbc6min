  "description": "Are you any good at map reading?\n\nDo you think that men are better at reading maps?\nAre women better at doing several things at once?\nNew research from the US says they are, and it can explain why. A team from the University of Pennsylvania says male and female brains are connected in very different ways, and this means that men and women are better at doing different things.\nThis week's question:\nHow much does the average human brain weigh? Is it:\na) 1.4 kg\nb) 2.2 kg\nc) 3.6 kg\nListen to the programme to find out the answer.\nThe male brain, the female brain\nEnd of Section\nShow All | Hide All\n(informal) clever, intelligent\nthink very hard to answer a question or solve a problem\nhalf (of something round in shape)\nto find your way around a new place, often using a map\ndoing several things at the same time\nthe maximum amount of time that you can concentrate on one thing\ndesigned to work in a particular way which cannot be changed\na statement that is often true but based on limited information\n",

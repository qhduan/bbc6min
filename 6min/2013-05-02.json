  "description": "Could a harpoon be used to clear up junk in space?\n\nA new study has shown that millions of pieces of junk floating in space could be a big hazard for satellites orbiting Earth.\nSerious collisions could take place that would damage the satellites we depend on for communication. Scientists fear the problem could get worse unless something is done to clear up the mess.\nIn this programme Rob and Jen discuss why the problem exists and how a harpoon could be used to clear up some of the mess.\nThis week's question:\nThe Russian satellite, Sputnik, was the first man-made object to be blasted into space. Do you know in which year it was launched?\na) 1957\nb) 1960\nc) 1967\nListen to the programme to find out the answer.\nCleaning up space\nEnd of Section\nShow All | Hide All\nrubbish; unwanted or useless things\nuntidy place\nbroken pieces from a larger object\nput away somewhere where they won't cause harm\nget something back to where it came from\nlots of objects in an untidy state\nsaying things that are untrue or ridiculous\nno longer needed\n",
